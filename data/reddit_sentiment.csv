Bitcoin Short Thesis,"https://preview.redd.it/0iedxgoitr3e1.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=11aaa42bce9b7b9fe5cf4a3944a7235a2f4ef51d

Michael Saylor went on CNBC this week and said bitcoin has returned 60% annually since inception and he predicts a more modest 29% annual return over the next 10 years. He neglected to mention that less than 1% of all bitcoin volume was before 2018. This would be like saying Microsoft returned 327,401% since IPO so we expect a modest 100,000% return over the next 30 years.

It is easily verifiable that bitcoin tracks almost identical to the 2x nasdaq. In 2022 bitcoin fell 75% in 10 months, coincidentally the same time we had the highest CPI prints in 40 years. No store of value or inflation hedge can fall 75% in 10 months by definition. Just this past week bitcoin fell 10% in two days!

In 2017 I saw someone on CNBC saying that with adoption the volatility will go down. It is seven years later and volume adjusted volatility is significantly higher than then. Also, this is just something people say with no evidence. Just an assumption.

Remember when everyone was waiting for bitcoin ETFs to be announced and someone hacked the SEC's twitter account and sent the price of BTC up 5% instantly? What store of value can be this manipulated over a tweet? Imagine if someone hacked trumps truth social account, or a government page, or any of the other government officials around the world that are involved in bitcoin. There are no circuit breakers on crypto exchanges and there are insane amounts of leverage in bitcoin.

There is nothing stopping any bad actor or state from manipulating the bitcoin market. Now that we are flooded with derivatives to short bitcoin, they can flood the market with bitcoin while shorting.

Why would the United States sell US dollars to buy bitcoin? Why would it sell gold and not give that money to the taxpayers or convert it to USD? What does it say about our confidence in our own currency if we decided to sell USD for bitcoin? It is frankly absurd, dangerous, and a waste of taxpayers money to pump up the bags of current bitcoin holders. They should instead sell their bitcoin and give that money back to its people that it serves. 30% of all bitcoin exists within the borders of China and Russia. We would hurt their holdings, instead of propping up their bags with our tax dollars.

If one hacked twitter tweet can move bitcoin in a 10% swing, what is bitcoin really?

I can absolutely lose on this trade. It is impossible to time bubbles. I do not even believe I have an edge on this trade. But I believe bitcoin is a giant ponzi scheme and I want to take a stab. I do not believe it is possible to gain an edge over a liquid market, or a derivatives market, but this is something I want to do because I believe with as much conviction as is possible that bitcoin is pure garbage.",100,185,1732856356.0,bitcoin short thesis,0.0

MicroStrategy in layman's terms,"It's been a while since the days of my regard college finance classes, but here is my understanding of MicroStrategy in layman's terms (kind of). Please correct me if anything is off.

The CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, has been saying that Bitcoin is the future because he expects Bitcoin to be an alternative reserve currency that will take up a larger portion of the global reserve currency pool over time, so the value of Bitcoin will inevitably go up over time (whether you agree with this premise is for another day). MSTR has been gradually loading up on Bitcoin in recent years. Given the recent US election result, the incoming administration is signaling a more open and favorable view of crypto adoption (although it's not clear if/how this will happen), especially with the appointment of Elon Musk to a meme government entity named after a meme coin. This led to a huge rally in the crypto market, especially for Bitcoin and subsequently MSTR who has been loading up on Bitcoin for a while now.

Now this is where things get crazy: MSTR is taking advantage of their rise in stock price to go out and ask institutional investors to buy their 0% interest convertible bonds. As of the most recent round, these bonds are structured as 5-year in maturity with 0% interest rate and a convertible price of 130% of current market price. To make the math simple, MSTR is currently trading at around $400 per share, so the bond holders can either convert the bonds into shares at ($400)(130%) = $520 per share in 5 years or get their principal back. Saylor is selling the promise that Bitcoin will go up significantly in the next 5 years (e.g. Bitcoin's 4-year halving cycle), so it's a great bargain for the institutional bond holders because they are essentially giving up the 5-year interest payments in exchange for an embedded call option to buy MSTR at $520/share in 5 years. Ask yourself, how likely that MSTR will only go up by 30% and trade at around $520 in 5 years? This is essentially the selling point that has the new institutional buyers hooked (whether you agree is a different story, but the institutional buyers seem to agree for now). On the MSTR side, Saylor is using the money to acquire additional Bitcoin and continue to hype up the FOMO sentiment around Bitcoin without ever worrying about financing cost in the meantime due to the 0% interest nature of these bonds. This will likely continue to drive Bitcoin and MSTR prices higher and higher for sometime, so this ""free money glitch"" phenomenon can continue to go on for a little while, creating a positive loop for MSTR to continue buying up more Bitcoin. So far this is the surface level explanation for the Bitcoin and MSTR pump as long as institutional investors are still buying into their convertible bonds, but it gets crazier...

You may ask why would anyone, especially big institutional buyers, just not buy Bitcoin or Bitcoin funds directly? The simple answer is, it has something to do with the investment mandate prohibiting the trading of crypto directly since they are deemed as risky assets, so they resort to something like MSTR bond offering as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure because bonds are generally considered safer. This is what Saylor meant by ""we are a Bitcoin treasury company"" during his recent CNBC interview. But that's not the full story... These institutional buyers (think pension funds, insurance liabilities, sovereign wealth funds, etc.) also need to worry about hedging their volatility and limit loss exposure to this risky asset class called Bitcoin. In the equity market, this big IV is directly reflected in the costly option premiums; as vega goes up so do option prices. However, the cost of embedded call option from the convertible bond is materially lower due to the inflexible nature of the convertible bond (e.g. only redeemable in 5 years, interest rate risk, opportunity cost, less liquid bond market, etc.). In other words, the cost of embedded call option through convertible bond offering is only the interest payments lost over the 5-year horizon and nothing more (except MSTR goes completely belly up, which I'll explain why it's unlikely later). However, these institutions can also turn around and sell call options in the open equity market at a premium. This is essentially a replicating portfolio that seeks to exchange the lost interest payments from the 0% bond for the call option premiums at a strike price of $520 in 5 years. Then, there is also the cherry on top with additional arbitrage potential that exploits the inflexibility of the bond market and the more expensive option premiums in the equity market due to high IV. Say it differently, the effective yield on these bonds are most likely higher than selling a vanilla corporate bond that pays the current market yield. This is what Saylor meant by ""the way we make money is we are selling the volatility \[to big institutional bond buyers who are willing to take up the 0% interest for 5 years deal while MSTR pays no interests\] and recycling it back to Bitcoin \[use the bond proceeds to hype up Bitcoin more\].""

Now to address the elephant in the room: what if Bitcoin has a massive correction and MSTR goes belly up? The short answer is, it's not likely and it doesn't really matter. First of all, MSTR is taking advantage of Bitcoin's 4-year halving cycle and structuring its bond maturity around it with the hope of that Bitcoin continues to play out the way MSTR expected so the bond obligations can either convert or roll over, especially now with more players trying to mimic their play and further pumping Bitcoin. In the meantime, they have virtually no interest obligations to worry about on their newly issued 0% convertible bonds for the next 5 years. 5-year is a long time horizon, which means they have plenty of opportunities to offload if they sense that something is going in the wrong direction. Secondly, there were simulations done to show how much Bitcoin needs to drop for MSTR to force liquidate Bitcoin to pay its debt obligation. The consensus price range is around $15k to $30k (feel free to challenge this claim if you think otherwise), which is not very likely given Bitcoin's current trading price of around $100k; Bitcoin price needs to drop significantly for this scenario to play. And hopefully they would have started to offload sooner before it drops to that level as explained by the first reason above. Lastly, the institutions have already hedged their losses, so it doesn't matter. They are effectively selling a fancy put option where the most they can lose is missing out on the 5-year interest payments if MSTR goes downhill in 5 years (they would just get the principal back and they still have priority claim over stockholders if things go really wrong). That said, the more likely playoff is that the institutional investors buy the convertible bonds by forgoing 5 years of interest payments, sell calls in the equity market at a big premium due to high IV, convert the bonds into shares in 5 years, and give the shares to call holders while taking a fat profit in the process (i.e. right end of short put payoff graph plus maybe a little bit more). Not to mention that these are some of the biggest and most sophisticated players in the financial market, so they have every interest to ensure that MSTR doesn't go completely belly up. Therefore, MSTR is likely here to stay for now as it continues to attract more institutional attention.

In summary:

\- MSTR can go up or down or sideway and it doesn't matter because institutions always find ways to skim from regard retails like you and me

\- If MSTR goes up, your shares will forever get diluted by your fellow regard call holders from bond converts while institutions get a fat check playing middleman

\- If MSTR goes belly up, institutions will get their money back first while you take another load behind Wendy's dumpster

\- If MSTR trades sideway, you get theta ganged

" NVDA's stock is down 10% in a week, is he still worth following?","NVIDIA reported impressive earnings, with quarterly revenues reaching $35 billion, up 94% year-over-year, with even stronger growth in the data center business, up 112%. Net income doubled to $20 billion and the company showed a strong outlook for future quarters, slightly exceeding market expectations. However, while growth remains impressive, fourth-quarter expected revenue of $37.5 billion is growing at a slower pace, well below the strong growth seen in previous quarters (122%, 262%, 265%). Since then, market concerns about a possible trade war in China have intensified, causing shares to fall

Despite the slowing growth concerns, analysts believe NVIDIA's fundamentals remain solid. The company's dominant position in artificial intelligence and its production capacity constraints mean that it still has plenty of room to grow its revenues. The stock is expected to reach $170 in the next three months. However, while NVIDIA still has investment potential, a number of other AI stocks could offer higher returns in the shorter term and are worth keeping an eye on. If you're looking for an AI stock that's more promising than NVDA but trades for less than 5x its earnings we can talk to each other

Where are future returns even supposed to come from? ,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way. ",356,266,1732800898.0,future returns even supposed come,0.0
Crazy yield farming…,"
The new administration seems to be very pro crypto, and with the next bull run is seemingly underway. Why not yolo into that?

Taking into account the crazy high dividends on CONY and MSTY. Why is it a bad thing to be long with a large play into both? 

For example, purchase a 1k shares of each… the monthly dividend would be exceptional. 

To protect against loss, buy long dated put contracts for the same funds. 

Reap the dividends while being protected on the initial investment via the put contracts. One months dividend will cover nearly all the premium of the contracts.

$HIMS is about to get absolutely wrecked. ,"Meta is about to announce a major change to their advertising policies that will decimate HIMS ability to efficiently acquire customers via their most critical channel: Facebook and Instagram Ads.

This is because Meta will be restricting brands like HIMS from using purchase-optimized campaigns, which many are speculating is due to legal liabilities associated with HIPAA violations and the use of the Facebook Pixel, the essential ingredient to running the most profitable type of Facebook ad campaigns.

How do I know this? I run an agency that specializes in Facebook ads and I can tell you this is every FB/IG advertiser's worst nightmare. I would be in a total panic if this was happening to me.

I’ve tested running ads without purchase optimization over many years and I can tell you they are absolute dog shit for getting an ROI. Full stop.

Back to HIMS.

They are especially fucked because:

1. They have a client/patient portal that is subject to strict HIPAA requirements. These advertisers are being specifically targeted by this change.
2. They are overly reliant on Meta ads like many direct to consumer brands. Losing the ability to leverage the best optimization settings will be catastrophic to HIMS customer acquisition cost on day 1.

These changes are going into effect on January 1 and Meta is expected to officially announce it on December 5th. 

If HIMS doesn’t immediately take a hit upon this being announced then I see their Q1-Q2 earnings to look like a flatline after what will likely be their biggest Q4 ever.

I have reasons to believe that Recursion (RXRX) will became quite popular in the next month.,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your mass, weight, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They have more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.

"Good Buying Opportunity After NVDA Pullback
","First of all, I'd like to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving, and in the midst of today's market break I'd like to share some of my analysis on NVDA

NVIDIA recently reported strong earnings, but the stock pulled back on profit retrenchment. Nonetheless, I think this may provide a buying opportunity for investors

AI growth logic remains strong

NVIDIA's dominant position in data centers allows it to benefit from the $1 trillion wave of global AI infrastructure investment. Despite increased skepticism about the potential for AI expansion, company management remains confident in the demand for AI chips, with the CFO stating that demand for next-generation Blackwell chips is “phenomenal” and that large customers show no signs of slowing their drive to invest in AI

Short-term challenges and long-term potential

In the short term, NVIDIA may face supply constraints and margin dilution, but these issues are seen as temporary. Although the growth rate is slowing down due to the “law of large numbers”, long-term demand is expected to continue to grow with the advancement of enterprise AI and sovereign AI

Technical trends and investment recommendations

From a technical perspective, NVIDIA is in an overall uptrend and the current pullback has not created a clear bearish reversal. I believe that the volatility in the stock price provides a good opportunity to add to a position on the pullback. NVIDIA's forward-looking PEG ratio is below the industry median, indicating that its valuation remains attractive

While volatility is likely to continue in the short term, NVIDIA's leadership in AI and long-term growth potential make it a noteworthy investment target

24h or 7 days/week stock markets?,"I have a strong belief that in the next 5-10 years we’ll see the stock market opening 24/7, similarly to crypto exchanges. NYSE already proposed 22h trading, so it seems to be in development phase.

To me, it’s a natural step given that larger investment firms regularly use algorithms, after hours trading already exists (but it’s quite limited) and exchanges and brokers would see their revenue increased.

Us, peasant retail traders/investors would have to choose between not sleeping to manage the night markets (I see this becoming the WSB standard) or just get screwed in those hours (as we do after hours).

To me, the question is not *if*, but *when* this will happen.

Thanksgiving is the biggest day of the year for regards to incentivize other regards to do regarded things with their money.,"With this fact known, I think we're about to have a huge pop in all markets starting tomorrow. I need help though putting together what I believe will be the ultimate payday plan if it all goes the way I believe it will.

I believe Bitcoin goes to at least $150,000 a coin this run, and most likely by May of 2025. The play I want to make is calls or longs on MicroStrategy ($MSTR) until the end of April of 2025, and then I want to reverse my position into puts or shorts to ride it all the way down when Bitcoin does its highly predictable cycle nosedive.

At this point, I'm not sure how MicroStrategy will do, because if Bitcoin loses its normal 50 to 80 percent, how does MicroStrategy justify itself until the next cryptocurrency cycle at some point in 2028 or 2029?

They do have 0% interest loans, so maybe nothing significant happens to them, because eventually Bitcoin always goes up and up, so maybe this play can be rinsed and repeated forever.

What do you think, and what plays are you going into tomorrow with? Do you think we get the normal pop we usually experience every cycle Thanksgiving, when all the common folk sit down together over dinner and discuss all the regarded investment ideas that they are or have gotten themselves into lately, or are people now to broke to make anything happen at this point?",37,14,1732790018.0,thanksgiving biggest day year regards incentivize regards regarded things money,0.0

Why NVDA is about to take off after taking a beating (technically speaking),"NVDA has been a kick in the ass lately. I'm holding 500 shares @ $142.25 and a bunch of calls at various dates and prices. 

I identified 3 support levels from June through September, 2 of which have been broken. The next stop is $131-ish IMO. 

Why? This level has been tested twice before and this will be the third time. The other 2 support levels have been tested 0-1 times and we're squashed like bugs. This level has more validity behind it.

In addition, the 9 RSI on the 60min chart (at the time of this writing) reads 22, which implies a stock that got the shit kicked out of it. On the daily, it's a 34. I thought this stock is in an uptrend, wild it got here. And this stock is NVDA, not to be played like a cuck. Real chutzpah it's all the way down here, if you ask me.

I think we will see a serious bounce back to test 150 over 2 weeks, which I base on absolutely nothing. But it's like a rubber band that you stretch so much that it will snap into your eye.

I would not be buying puts at this level, I'd be buying SHARES, or calls, and take a little short term heat for a big payout.

And why did I not wait to buy at this prices instead of buying at $142? 

Bc I'm an idiot and made an impulsive trade. You can't time the top or bottom and I have no doubt it will come back. But how far do I want my ass stretched to get there? 

A question we all must ask ourselves.

Good day to you all

$OKLO is Undervalued Relative to $SMR,"It’s mind-boggling that Oklo trades at **\~37%** of NuScale’s market cap ($2.6B vs $6.9B). I strongly believe this valuation disparity will eventually correct. For context, if Oklo were valued similarly to NuScale, its share price could exceed **$58/share**.

Oklo is positioned to lead the domestic nuclear sector;

* Capital Efficiency: arguably the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, having enough cash on hand to fund through their initial builds, with a low burn rate.
* Strong Leadership: executive leadership team with PhDs, Sam Altman as chairman, and a current board member slated to lead the Energy sector (Chris Wright.) Jake and Caroline (founders) are extremely passionate about the technology and opportunity, signaling to investors that they are keeping their equity for the long haul.
* Proven Technology: EBR-II operated through decades of testing between 1964-1994 at INL, clearly demonstrating that the molten sodium fast reactor can operate reliably and efficiently overtime.
* First-mover Advantage: Aurora is on target towards 2027 deployment at INL. Oklo has had the most regulatory engagement relative to other advanced reactor projects and have hired on a lot of former NRC regulatory staff. Also, unlike their competitors, they’ve already secured fuel from the DOE for their first Aurora build.
* Commercialization Model: their ‘owner and operator’ model will allow them to scale rapidly and profitably alongside AI data centers throughout the 2030s. NRC whitepapers suggested that subsequent site reviews will take as little as 7 months, and Oklo will be able to debt finance project builds through future projected cash flows. They currently have 2.1GW in customer commitments, most notably from Equinix and Wyoming hyperscale.
* Alternative Revenue Streams: Oklo has positioned itself to benefit from other revenue sources; uranium recycling to repurpose fuel from nuclear waste reserves, and the manufacturing of radioisotopes through the recently proposed acquisition of Atomic Alchemy.

In contrast, NuScale is in a much worse position with regard to timelines:

* NuScale doesn’t have any construction or operating licenses, they only have a design certification for their 12x50MW plant. In order for their customers to obtain those licenses, it requires a 24-36 month NRC review period that **has not been initiated yet**. This is why NuScale was projecting their first builds in early 2030s, which is years behind Oklo’s 2027 target and that’s probably being optimistic (as you’ll see below).
* The reason why OKLO is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a COLA, which seeks approval for design, construction and operating, only taking them 24 months. Compare this to NuScale, where **every individual customer** needs to create and submit detailed plans, then wait 24-36 months for build and operating licenses.
* It was a strategic choice by NuScale and others to only sell designs and not be an ‘owner and operator’ like Oklo. They would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves, which does come with additional hurdles and liability, but allows for **much faster** scaling.
* Putting aside those timelines, Nuscale’s 12x50MW plant was found to be **not economically viable**, so they are back to get a standard design approval for their 6x77MW plant. Considering this factor along with the licensing timelines, their 6x77MW will likely take until 2033 for customer deployment.

Looking ahead, there is significant potential for an OpenAl partnership to materialize in the wake of all the demand that we've been seeing. Sam Altman recently visited DC to pitch lawmakers on the need for multiple 5GW data centers and pushed for the NRC to further streamline SMR approvals to meet those needs. If Oklo would be able to supply just a fraction OpenAl's future energy consumption, that would translate to a massive recurring revenue stream. Combine this with the fact that they are entering a more friendly regulatory environment, especially with Chris Wright heading the DOE under the Trump administration.

**TLDR:** $SMR is far behind $OKLO in licensing timelines (by as much as 6+ years) and it does not appear to be reflected in the market. Aside from the obvious timeline advantage, Oklo stands to benefit from their capital efficiency, leadership team, first-mover advantage, commercialization model, and diversified revenue mix. If Oklo was trading at NuScale’s valuation (which I see as realistic), we’d be looking at over **$58/share**.",116,87,1732727191.0,oklo undervalued relative smr,0.0
NVDA is about to take off (technically speaking): why I feel more confident following my previous post ,"Greetings,

I hope everyone is getting ready to talk stocks and politics at the Thanksgiving table because that's what the holiday is all about, amiright?

I for one will be talking about NVDA.

I posted earlier today around 10am-11am EST and said that NVDA was gonna stop sliding at 131-ish, since there is a good support there.

And what happened???? The turkey came home to roast

Yes, that's right - it snapped back like a rubber band into your eye. Ok, so that means that the support level that I suggested held for a 3rd time, making it very reliable.

And to add some sugar to that sweet potato pie, the stock closed up $3 from the low and a bullish pattern formed throughout the whole day - the cup and handle (""C+H"").

If you don't know what the C+H pattern looks like, go to your mom's breakfront where she keeps all the tchotchkes and the fine china and take out a tea cup. Hold it up and look at it from the side, with the cup's handle on the right side. Then look at the screenshots I uploaded. It's the same thing.

This mean stock go up.

Interesting how NVDA held at that support level and then the entire day formed a C+H pattern... Hmmm... 

Smells bullish, that's the vibe.

Why $SPY is the Real Thanksgiving Turkey 🦃,"Alright degenerates, gather round the table because I’ve cooked up some sweet Thanksgiving DD, and no, it’s not cranberry sauce (but this could be just as saucy). Here’s the deal: Thanksgiving isn’t just about stuffing your face and awkwardly dodging Aunt Karen’s questions about why you’re ""still single""—it’s also PRIME TIME for unsolicited stock and crypto pitches at family dinners. And that, my friends, is why Black Friday is not just for TVs at 80% off, but also for **stupidly green markets.**

Here’s how it works:

1. **Family Financial Influencers™:** Grandpa brings up how he’s *still* holding Exxon since the 80s, your cousin Chad flexes his crypto portfolio (which is 90% down, but whatever), and your tech-savvy niece just learned about AI stocks and is suddenly Jim Cramer. Everyone at the table is buzzing with ""hot picks"" while passing the mashed potatoes. This is not financial advice… but it kinda is.
2. **The FOMO Catalyst:** Uncle Bob hears about ""some stock with a weird ticker"" (it’s ACHR, Bob, get with it) and thinks, “Why the hell am I not in this?” By the time the pumpkin pie rolls around, he’s downloading Robinhood. Multiply Uncle Bobs across America, and boom, retail frenzy ensues Friday morning.
3. **Markets are Closed Thursday:** This is key. People have 24 whole hours to stew in their newfound *knowledge*. By the time the market opens Friday, all that pent-up Thanksgiving YOLO energy explodes into buying pressure. Everyone’s a financial genius after 3 glasses of wine and a turkey coma.
4. **Black Friday Greenery:** You know how everyone shops like maniacs on Black Friday? Stocks are no different. This is the ""stock market doorbuster effect."" Everyone's piling into stocks like they’re $5 air fryers. And best of all, it’s also the gateway to the “Santa Claus rally.” As Christmas shopping kicks off, so might the stock market's annual tradition of going full holiday cheer mode. It’s like the market whispering, “You’ve been good this year, here’s a little green to celebrate.” 🎅📈

# My Prediction for Friday:

* **$SPY** opens green (duh): Like your drunk uncle's karaoke rendition of ""Sweet Caroline,"" it’s inevitable.
* **Tech stocks?** Probably up because Aunt Susan heard about AI once on The Today Show and now thinks it’s the key to immortality (it is).
* **Crypto?** Let’s be real—Cousin Chad is hyping Bitcoin like he’s got Satoshi on speed dial. It’s probably gonna pump harder than Grandma’s blood pressure when she finds out you brought store-bought pie.
* **Random meme stocks?** Oh yeah, because someone’s cousin brought up “that one company with the short interest that shall not be mentioned.”
* **ACHR?** $ACHR will be taking a flight (literally and figuratively) this Friday—WSB's favorite bird is ready to soar, and you degenerates are gonna love it. 🚁💸

**TL;DR:** Thanksgiving isn’t just about turkey—it’s a breeding ground for half-baked stock ideas. When Friday rolls around, we’re gonna see a tsunami of retail money hit the markets. $SPY gonna pop, and we’ll all be riding the gravy train. **To the moon or the Wendy's dumpster, GODSPEED** 🫡

PLUG - and the Hydrogen sector - is primed to go up big,"How do you do, fellow autists? Today's DD is an older meme, but it checks out. That's right, our favorite hydrogen power play - PLUG.

PLUG Power's revenue has been growing fast over the past few years. In their most recent quarter, they reported $260 million in revenue, which is a huge jump compared to where they were just a year ago. This shows that their hydrogen tech is really starting to take off, and they're making big strides in building up their customer base.

What's even better is their gross profit is improving too. They've gone from some pretty hefty losses in the past to now getting closer to break-even. That means they're really starting to scale up. They’ve been investing heavily in R&D and infrastructure, but those costs should start paying off soon.

And here’s the kicker—PLUG is locking down major partnerships and contracts with huge players like Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot.

Other catalysts:

1: PLUG looking to get a $1.8ish billion loan from the government

2: Possible old CEO stepping down to insert new blood.

TLDR: PLUG is primed to move.

ERJ - This stock is challenging two behemoths and I like their chances,"This is obviously not financial advice. I just like the stock and I want to talk about it.

Embraer recently hit it's highest price in the last 10 years and it comes after a disastrous failed merger with Boeing in 2020. They spent years prepping the company for the merger and were left with their dicks hanging out when Boeing backed out last minute (Broke ass Boeing didn't have the money to go thru with the acquisition). It was the best thing that could've ever happened to them. 

With a new CEO and a new direction, Embraer is setting itself up to challenge both Boeing and Airbus in the near future. They're already the third largest commercial air aircraft manufacturer in the world and their market share only increases with the higher demand from Airlines for fuel efficient aircrafts and their growing Military and private jet segments.

Embraer aircrafts will soon be 100% of American Airline's regional fleet and many other orders to come. Also, passengers absolutely love the experience of flying on an Embraer. 

Another interesting thing about Embraer is their track record on innovation. I'd recommend you guys researching and reading up on their EVE project. They're basically leading the field in the urban air mobility segment (basically taxi/uber but with planes) and it seems very promising. They are developing a small electric aircraft intended to be used for short urban travel (up to 100 KM /60 miles).

That being said, I have to confess one the biggest reasons I like ERJ is because it would be a tremendous FUCK YOU to Boeing if they stole their share of the market. ERJ stock price is already higher than Airbus although Airbus has a much larger Market Cap. But fuck them too. ERJ to the fucking moon. 

I'm absolutely new to the stock game and should not be trusted. But I do invite you guys to learn more about this company.

If one of you regards want to take a look at their Q3 returns, here is the link: https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1207478-earnings-results-3rd-quarter-2024 

I also would recomend reading this interview from their CEO. He shares his vision for the future of the company and how they want to get there:https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/ceo-embraer-aerospace-company-rewrote-strategy-boeing-joint-venture-loss-francisco-gomes-neto/

"Red Cat Holdings, Inc. (RCAT) Due Diligence Report  ","**Company Overview**

Red Cat Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in the development of drone systems and solutions for military and commercial applications. In response to the United States renewing bans on DJI drones through legislation such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the American Security Drone Act, Red Cat focuses on providing advanced, domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies. The company's products aim to enhance drone operations while addressing national security concerns by supplying secure, American-made drone solutions. Through its subsidiaries, including **Teal Drones** and **FlightWave**, Red Cat offers products that support reconnaissance, surveillance, and other critical functions, delivering innovative solutions to defense organizations and industries requiring drone capabilities[.](https://imgur.com/a/8E9PtMl)

**Investment Thesis**

Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat Holdings, has outlined significant developments that position the company for substantial growth and potential undervaluation in the market. The following points highlight the company's strategic advantages and growth prospects, incorporating recent developments from the company's earnings call and industry dynamics.

# 1. Significant U.S. Army Contract

**SRR Program Win**

* **Contract Award**: Red Cat's subsidiary, **Teal Drones**, has been selected as the sole winner of the U.S. Army's **Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program**, securing a contract to deliver **5,880 systems**. Each system includes **two drones and one controller**, amounting to a total of **11,760 drones**.
* **Contract Value**: The average price of a system is around **$45,000**, depending on configuration. This implies a base contract value of approximately **$264 million**.
* **Competitive Edge**: Teal Drones was chosen over better-funded competitors like Skydio, which has raised over **$700 million** in venture capital. Despite being an underdog, Teal's technological advancements and ability to meet the Army's stringent requirements led to this significant win.

**Additional Revenue Streams**

* **Maintenance and Support**: The contract includes provisions for repairs, training, and spare parts, which could increase the contract's value by an additional **50-70%**. Historically, programs of record have seen significant revenue from spares and support over many years.
* **Expansion Potential**: The SRR program's success positions Red Cat to secure additional contracts with other military branches, U.S. government agencies, and NATO allies.

**Program of Record Status**

* **Simplified Procurement**: Achieving **Program of Record** status streamlines the procurement process for other defense organizations, allowing them to purchase directly off the SRR contract. This designation enhances credibility and accelerates additional orders and long-term partnerships.

# 2. Anticipated Growth and Revenue Projections

**Projected Revenues**

* **Fiscal Year Projections**: The company has provided guidance of **$50-55 million** for calendar year 2025, based on the initial phases of the SRR contract.
* **Potential Upside**: With additional appropriations and the possibility of accelerated procurement, revenues could increase significantly. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes approximately **$79.5 million** in funding for the program line that supports SRR.
* **Long-Term Outlook**: Including potential additional contracts and support services, annual revenues could reach around **$100 million**, excluding new contracts.

**Future Contracts**

* **International Demand**: NATO allies and other international partners have shown strong interest in the Black Widow drone, especially after the SRR program win. Some opportunities may eclipse the SRR program in size and value.
* **Expansion into Asia-Pacific**: The company is also engaging with Asian allies, such as Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea, to explore additional sales opportunities.
* **Replicator Initiative Participation**: Red Cat is involved in the Department of Defense's **Replicator program** to mass-produce affordable, autonomous drones, potentially leading to larger future contracts.

# 3. Valuation Compared to Industry Peers

**Market Valuation Discrepancy**

* **Underappreciated Value**: Despite securing a landmark contract and demonstrating significant growth potential, Red Cat's market valuation remains lower than private peers like Skydio, Anduril Industries, and Shield AI.

**Revenue Multiples**

* **Industry Comparison**: Competitors are trading at revenue multiples ranging from **18× to 28×**. For instance:
   * **Shield AI**: Trading at **18.4×** revenue.
   * **Anduril Industries**: Trading at **28×** revenue.
   * **Skydio**: Recent valuation at **$2.2 billion**, trading at **22×** revenue.
* **Red Cat's Multiple**: Based on the company's guidance, Red Cat trades at a significantly lower multiple, suggesting substantial upside potential when aligning with industry standards.

**Upside Potential**

* **Implied Valuation**: Using projected revenues of **$100 million** and applying a conservative industry revenue multiple of **20×**, Red Cat's implied market capitalization could be **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: With approximately **75.5 million** shares outstanding, this valuation translates to an implied stock price of approximately **$26.49** per share.
* **Potential Upside**: This represents an approximate **182% increase** from the current stock price of **$9.39**.

# 4. Strategic Capital Management

**No Immediate Capital Raise**

* **Financial Flexibility**: The company has filed a **$100 million mixed securities shelf registration**, allowing Red Cat to issue various types of securities over time. However, management has indicated **no immediate plans** to raise capital through equity offerings.
* **Utilizing Debt Instruments**: Red Cat has room on its existing debt instrument and may use this for short-term capital needs, minimizing shareholder dilution.

**Minimal Capital Raise if Needed**

* **Operational Continuity**: Any potential capital raise would be around **$10-15 million** to ensure operational efficiency without significant dilution.

**Investor Assurance**

* **Fiscal Responsibility**: CEO Jeff Thompson emphasizes a prudent approach to capital management, focusing on maximizing shareholder value and achieving cash-flow-positive operations.

# 5. Product Development and Expansion Opportunities

**Advanced Drone Focus**

* **Teal's Black Widow Drone**
   * **Technological Advancements**: The **Black Widow** is a **3-pound**, folding, backpack-size drone capable of flying autonomously without GPS, using an internal map for navigation.
   * **Electronic Warfare Resilience**: It can operate without emitting radio frequencies for up to **40 minutes**, making it less susceptible to detection and jamming—a critical advantage in modern warfare.
   * **Features**: Rugged, reliable, fully modular, quiet, long flight time and range, high-resolution cameras, stealth modes, onboard compute for AI and autonomy, capability to carry secondary payloads, and operation in electronic warfare environments.
* **Webb Controller**
   * **Innovative Design**: Teal designed the **Webb** controller from scratch in less than five months. It is now the **program of record controller** for SRR.
   * **User-Centric Features**: Easy to use, comfortable to hold, modular, supports RF silent and stealth modes, uses the same battery as the drone, simplifying logistics.
* **Manufacturing Capabilities**
   * **High-Volume Production**: Teal has designed the Black Widow and Webb for **mass production**, with the capacity to produce **hundreds of systems per month** in low-rate initial production (LRIP) and scaling to **thousands per month** by the end of next year.
   * **Scalability**: The manufacturing facility can increase output by adding shifts, including moving to two or three shifts and operating on weekends.

**Edge 130 Drone**

* **FlightWave Acquisition**: Red Cat's acquisition of FlightWave adds the **Edge 130** drone to its portfolio.
* **Order Backlog**: Over **200 orders** for the Edge 130, expected to be delivered in Q1.
* **New Facility**: The company is moving into a new factory to accommodate production needs.

**Mass Deployment Readiness**

* **Scalability**: Red Cat's drones are well-suited for large-scale deployment initiatives like the Replicator program and can meet the high demand seen in conflicts such as Ukraine.
* **Red Cat Futures Initiative**
   * **R&D Focus**: The company is pursuing research and development opportunities to integrate capabilities with strategic partners, enhancing their product offerings and addressing future mission needs.
   * **Software Ecosystem**: Plans to offer a menu of configurations and software applications for different use cases, leveraging the onboard compute power for AI and autonomy.

# 6. Increased Industry Recognition

**Media Coverage**

* **National Attention**: Red Cat and Teal Drones have received significant attention from major outlets, including features in **The Wall Street Journal**, highlighting their strategic importance and technological advancements.

**Investor Interest**

* **Market Visibility**: Heightened visibility is attracting major investment banks and potential investors, increasing the company's profile within the investment community.

**Blue UAS Listing**

* **DIU Blue UAS Refresh Challenge**: Red Cat has submitted the Black Widow and Edge 130 drones for inclusion in the Department of Defense's Blue UAS list.
* **Progress**: Both drones have passed initial testing phases and are moving into the final stage, involving review of bill of materials and cybersecurity practices.

# 7. Competitive Landscape and Industry Challenges

**Competitor Challenges**

* **Skydio's Setbacks**
   * **Operational Failures**: Skydio's drones underperformed in Ukraine, suffering from electronic warfare tactics that led to loss of control and drones going off course.
   * **Loss of SRR Contract**: Skydio lost out to Teal Drones in the SRR program, despite significant venture capital backing.
* **Other Competitors**
   * **AeroVironment's Switchblade Drones**: Faced difficulties due to Russian jamming and GPS blackouts, impacting their reliability.
   * **Cyberlux's Production Issues**: Failed to meet production and delivery goals, affecting credibility.

**Red Cat's Competitive Edge**

* **Technological Superiority**: Red Cat's drones are designed to withstand electronic warfare, operate without GPS, and meet the rigorous requirements of modern battlefields.
* **Mission-Driven Approach**: The company's focus on building drones specifically to meet the Army's needs contributed to winning the SRR contract.
* **Manufacturing Readiness**: Red Cat's ability to mass-produce drones efficiently positions it favorably against competitors who may struggle with production scaling.

# 8. Strategic Partnerships and Government Relations

**Advocacy and Policy Support**

* **Government Engagement**: Red Cat is actively working with the Department of Defense and Congress to ensure funding and support for expanding the SRR program.
* **NDAA Funding**: The National Defense Authorization Act includes approximately **$79.5 million** for the SRR program line, with efforts to increase appropriations in future fiscal years.

**International Opportunities**

* **NATO Allies**: Multiple NATO countries are showing strong interest in adopting the Black Widow drone, with some potential contracts larger than the SRR program.
* **Asia-Pacific Expansion**: Engagement with countries like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea opens additional markets.

# 9. Management and Leadership

**Experienced Team**

* **CEO Jeff Thompson**: Emphasizes fiscal responsibility, strategic growth, and maximizing shareholder value.
* **George Matus**: Founder of Teal Drones, instrumental in designing the Black Widow and Webb controller, focused on meeting Army requirements and soldier feedback.
* **Geoff Hitchcock**: Brings decades of experience from previous roles at AeroVironment, contributing to securing programs of record and international expansion.

**Board of Directors**

* **General Paul Funk II**: Recently joined the board, providing valuable insights from his military experience, emphasizing the importance of kinetic capabilities and battlefield needs.

**Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations**

* **Current Market Capitalization**: Approximately **$480 million** (reflecting recent stock performance).
* **Current Stock Price**: **$9.39** (as per the latest data).
* **Shares Outstanding**: Approximately **75.5 million**.
* **Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue**: **$100 million** (potentially higher with additional appropriations and contracts).
* **Industry Revenue Multiple**: **20×** annual revenue.

**Implied Valuation**

* **Implied Market Capitalization**: $100 million × 20 = **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately **$26.49** per share.

**Potential Upside**

* **Percentage Increase**: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately **182% increase**.

**Considerations and Assumptions**

* **Revenue Achievement**: The company successfully achieves the projected revenues through the execution of the SRR contract and potential additional contracts with other military branches, government agencies, and international customers.
* **Market Valuation Alignment**: The market values Red Cat at a 20× revenue multiple, consistent with industry peers.
* **Technological Leadership**: Red Cat continues to innovate and maintain its technological edge over competitors.
* **Production Scaling**: The company effectively scales production to meet demand, maintaining quality and efficiency.

**Conclusion**

Red Cat Holdings appears to be undervalued relative to its industry peers. With a significant U.S. Army contract, anticipated growth, and involvement in key defense initiatives, the company is strategically positioned for potential expansion. The high demand for reliable drones in modern conflicts, combined with competitors' shortcomings, amplifies Red Cat's market opportunity. The company's mission-driven approach, technological advancements, and manufacturing readiness provide a strong foundation for growth.

Investors should consider these factors while also conducting their own due diligence. The discrepancy between Red Cat's current market valuation and that of its peers suggests substantial upside potential.

🏳️‍🌈 The Fruitcake Portfolio 🏳️‍🌈,"[The Fruitcake Portfolio v.1](https://preview.redd.it/i2yojf3sfd3e1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=636529c7950cdddd488f20aff86f74aef67ed951)

Greetings my friends, and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey.

What you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved, but essentially this is a watchlist on E\*Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations.

The purpose of this portfolio--gey.

By tilting heavily to the gey factor, we hope to realize the rawdog premium.

The core of this portfolio is Grindr (GRND). It holds a 27% allocation (I had to convince myself to not make it 30% for diversification's sake, although such is still not off the table entirely). The path of gey is risky, but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ+ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey.

The other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey-in-some-wey. In reality, this means we must invest in stocks typically designated ""women"" stocks. Now personally, I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn't some sci-fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc, doesn't mean that it isn't a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and \[redacted\] in my real accounts. However, in this portfolio, beauty, cosmetics, and baby/household care products (diapers, etc) make up around 26% in total (17% for ELF, 9% for \[redacted\]).

Hims & Hers (HIMS) was selected for it's exposure to the men's sexual health market. They got ED pills, condoms, lube, prostate massagers, cock rings, etc. With the addition of a 10% HIMS allocation, The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours, back arched, with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS, there is also a small 2% allocation to Church & Dwight (CHD), because they make Trojan condoms.

FBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10% of the portfolio.

If Warren Buffet has Coca Cola (KO), then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks (SBUX), because Starbucks is zesty, and therefore, perfectly suited, as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is more of a growthy-value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock, however those tend to fail. However, CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan, vegetarian, paleo dishes, and more. So yes, CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick, but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey.

There is an 11% allocation split between Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Lululemon (LULU), and Nike (NKE). Overall, this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here.

Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for The Fruitcake Portfolio? If you are a 35 year old male millennial, and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella, then you are no novice to the wey of gey.

Finally, we have a tiny 1% allocation to Google (GOOG). Literally the alphabet company.

Something interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap, then things will be more balanced. I’ve considered adding a SCV as well.

\----------------

For stocks and ETFS that didn't make the cut, I had:

TSLA & FSLR: The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy.

VEGN: Basically a cruelty-free S&P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio.

\[redacted\]: An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It's particularly NSFW.

\[redacted\]: Weed Stocks.

TGT: Target is Target.

BBWI: Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments--with bubbles (ofc).

RVLV: Clothing Retailer.

\----------------

If anyone has any ideas of how they might improve this portfolio, feel free to let me know. Any interesting stocks that you think might fit well in the mix? Would you swap out anything?

Brazil Bear Case?,"Just from a quick glance at the figures, I don't understand why the Brazilian index and stocks are so aggressively underperforming?   
  
Do they see something that I don't? The index is below Covid lows, stocks like XP, NU, ASAI and the general economy is growing and Lula has a good head on his shoulders despite morons screaming about him being a commie he's never done anything to indicate that he will disrupt Brazil's growth. It's not like there's any geopolitical tension in the region.

If the concerns are just temporary raised fed rates, and sentiment about Lula being a commie so Bolsonarists are just shovelling money out of the country in protest, is this not a great buying opportunity?

"Kohl's (KSS) at $15 - Seriously Undervalued, Here's Why 🚀","Alright, gang, hear me out. I think (Kohls) KSS is an absolute gem right now, sitting at $15. Here's the case:

1. Franchise Group tried to buy KSS at $69 per share in April 2022 💸Yeah, you read that right. Franchise Group was willing to pay $69 for Kohl's not even two years ago. The deal was rejected (major facepalm move on Kohl's part), but it gives us a benchmark for what the market thought KSS was worth. Now, let’s take a moment to think about why Franchise Group was willing to pay that much... This wasn't some random offer. Kohls has value. It's just undervalued right now.
2. Oak Street Real Estate Deal – A $2B Real Estate Portfolio 🏢After that rejection, Oak Street stepped in and made an offer to buy a portion of Kohl's real estate for $2B. Wait—$2 billion for a portion of the real estate? At the current market cap of $1.65 billion, that tells you one thing: Kohl's real estate alone is worth more than the ENTIRE company. If we’re being conservative, the real estate portfolio could easily be worth $4-5 billion, which is well above where the stock is trading right now. So, the company’s assets are massively underpriced.
3. 32% Short Interest – Don’t need to tell you guys about potential, you know the drill.
4. Seasonal Play – December to January Pop Historically, Kohl’s stock tends to do well in the December to January timeframe, often gaining around 25-30%. Worst-case scenario, you’re breaking even based on the past 5 years if you’re holding through this period, but with the setup here, I’d bet on a solid upside. Buy in December, sell in January, rinse and repeat.

TL;DR

\* Franchise Group offered $69 for Kohl's in 2022. The stock is $15 today.

\* Oak Street valued Kohl's real estate at $2B for a portion. That’s a huge asset undervaluation.

\* 32% short interest

\* December to January historically sees a 30% upside.

So, what’s the risk at $15? This stock is undervalued and has additional catalysts.

This isn’t financial advice, but this setup has ""degenerate gains"" written all over it. 🤘

"Stock is Trading at All-Time Lows with a Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short Interest— Absurd.","Apollo tried to fund a Kohls buyout in 2022 for 8B (nothing has changed drastically about its business between now and then).

Let’s break down Kohl’s ($KSS). The stock is down 20% today, trading at an all-time low with a market cap under $2 billion. Meanwhile, the company generates $600 million in free cash flow (FCF) annually and owns $7 billion in real estate assets. with net assets of $4B.

1.The Business: Kohl’s still did $18 billion in sales for fiscal 2024, even without fully capitalizing on its Sephora partnership, which is boosting foot traffic in every store its been rolled out in (and they continue to roll out more) .

2. Valuation and Cash Flow: •	Kohl’s generated $300 million in net income last fiscal year and nearly double that in free cash flow (FCF): $600 million. Based on this quarter they’ll likely land somewhere in a similar ball park. •	Historically, Kohl’s has averaged $1 billion in FCF, meaning current results are already deeply discounted. And yet, the stock is trading at just 3x FCF. •	The discrepancy between net income and FCF comes from non-cash expenses like depreciation on their $7 billion real estate portfolio. This isn’t “money burned”—it’s accounting noise.

3. Balance Sheet Strength: •	Kohl’s has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright—hard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario. •	Liabilities are about 11B, Yes, they exist, but Kohl’s is far from distressed, with manageable debt relative to their assets and FCF generation.

4. Short Interest: •	Over 30% of Kohl’s shares are shorted. Shorts betting on total collapse might not fully understand the cash generation and real estate value here. Any positive catalyst—a strategic pivot, real estate monetization, or improved retail sentiment.

5. CEO Departure: •	Kohl’s just announced its CEO, Tom Kingsbury, is stepping down—news that likely contributed to today’s selloff. But here’s the kicker: Kingsbury was adamant about NOT selling Kohl’s assets. His departure reopens the possibility of a real estate monetization play, which could unlock billions in value.

    •	Remember: Kohl’s rejected an $8 billion buyout offer funded by Apollo Global Management in 2022. That was four times today’s valuation.

The Bottom Line: For a $2 billion market cap, you’re buying: •	$7 billion in real estate assets (including 400+ owned stores). •	$600 million annual FCF, even in a “bad” year. •	A company that generates enough cash to pay an 11% dividend yield.

If you told me I could buy $7 billion in hard assets (4B net of liabilities) and $600 million in annual cash flow for under $2 billion, I’d say yes every time. That’s Kohl’s today. This isn’t a growth story—it’s a cash-and-assets story. You’re betting that the business, even if it declines slowly, will return far more than its current valuation. Or that someone with deep pockets will take notice and bid. Either way, this valuation is ridiculous.

Shorts, good luck.

Update on Macy’s and the mysterious case of the „missing” $154 million,"I posted some hours earlier on this subject: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/sKGrF7YHDE

The comedy continues, and we are quite sure that it wasn’t Milton - 

New reporting suggests that this may have been because of some perverse incentives: 

„For years, Macy’s Inc. touted its ability to boost profits by cutting delivery costs and trimming other expenses on calls with Wall Street analysts. Then on Monday, the department store chain surprised investors by revealing that those very costs had become the source of an internal investigation into what the company has described as a multimillion-dollar employee plot to manipulate the metrics.”

MSTR: Don't Mistake Leverage for Genius [DD],"Microstrategy (MSTR) has a simple strategy of using various forms of debt to buy bitcoin. Regardless of your stance on Bitcoin, it begs the question: **why** invest in Microstrategy over Bitcoin? In the words of Steve Eisman, “They mistook *leverage for genius*.”

Sure, Microstrategy is more leveraged than Bitcoin, but you can also leverage your bet on Bitcoin; take out margin, buy a leveraged instrument on an exchange, or, my favorite, taking an extra shift at Wendy's.

So, let's compare the strategy. How would you do if you just bought leveraged Bitcoin instead of Microstrategy, and mimicked their strategy? I'll walk us through returns from the bottom of the BTC bear market on December 30, 2022, until today.

On 30 December 2022, MSTR had a market capitalization of **1.63B.** They held **132,500 bitcoin** valued at $**2.19B** according to their Q4 earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/dw36tu03oa3e1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=783ed81a61bb033f974783e70fe2c51899d6325f

Bitcoin was around 16,529 on December 30 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/acmcnyhhoa3e1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fc1f50ffa72683d4fc448fe2ef98720ace19ff9

They also had total long term debt of $2.4B.

https://preview.redd.it/k9zzwx15oa3e1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa6a2fb9169bf7ec53956d8412f04af423e6316

Note, I'm excluding their current debt and assets from this, as I'm more interested in their BTC holdings vs. their long term liabilities (debt).

Importantly, their core loss-leading operating business was generating about $30M a year of EBITDA. You could easily value this at **Zero**, but a generous 20X multiple of 30M EBITDA would be valued at around \~$600M

https://preview.redd.it/rlnskdbaoa3e1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3029489eb18d94bea7955fd3313210b3a2870eb

So, you were buying a $600M operating business and $2.19B of bitcoin, minus $2.4B in debt, for 1.63B market cap.

Assuming you could just sell the operating business to cover debt and focus on the value of the bitcoin, that would be **$2.19B in bitcoin** and $**1.8B in debt**. So net assets of **390M**.

Owning 2.19B in bitcoin on 390M of net assets is about **5.6x** leverage.

If you took the same 1.63B needed to buy all of MSTR’s market cap at the time and bought bitcoin at 5.6x leverage you would own $**9.128B worth of BTC**, or about **552,241 BTC** at the December 30 2022 prices.

With BTC at 93K today, you would have turned your $1.63B into **$51.3B** if you used 5.6x leveraged BTC, a **3,106%** ROI.

How did MSTR do over the same time period?

https://preview.redd.it/cyc8kfjxoa3e1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0aac60559159b94bc2815e0bbba7ccfb7d5e5b6

Over the same duration, even with NAV premium expansion, MSTR has returned 2,452%. That's the difference between turning your 1.6B into 41B or 51B. A huge discrepancy!

TLDR; Adjusting for leverage based on MSTR’s bitcoin holdings vs debt, you would have been better off just buying leveraged bitcoin.

$VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. 

Who is $VSH?

Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY.

Why $VSH is printing money:

Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts.

Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong.

Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco.

Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. 

Recent Catalysts: 

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming.

Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. 

Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products:
	•	GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure.
	•	RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards.
Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are.

Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money.

Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot.

Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from:
	•	Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical.
	•	IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it.

The Stock Is Still Cheap

Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls.

FNMA: Come back in 2026/2027,"For those of us that have followed the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac trades since they went into conservatorship, my theory is that it's worth waiting until the end of 2026. Here's my thinking:

* Political
   * Trump likely wants to privatize Fannie and Freddie. He looked into it his first time but the major things holding it back were capital reserves and political will.
   * With a Trump 2nd term, reducing the size of government is one of his biggest goals. In general, privatization is one of the most common ways of doing this. Given that Fannie and Freddie were taken over in 2008, this makes them a prime candidate to be re-privatized. 
   * Republicans have the power in Congress at the moment. 
* Financial
   * At the time, based on the plan and rules they would need about $275-300B in reserves. They currently have about $165B in reserves. In recent years, they generate about $25B in net income per year. While that's about a $100B gap, they can also raise capital through private and public means (private investors, issuing stock). 

Why 2026? Pure speculation from here on:

* Financial
   * In 2 years, they will be in a better capitalized position. They will likely have made about $50B more in income, thus having a total of about $215B in reserves and about a $50B gap in capitalization needed. Given their economics and situation, it could be a tempting investment for investors (particularly hedge funds). 
* Political
   * While this is in line, philosophically, with what Trump wants to do, it won't be a money saver and thus not likely a priority under say DOGE. This would be more symbolic and thus, in my thinking, is a lower priority. 
   * I'm guessing 2024-2026 will be somewhat politically turbulent. This will be the time that Trump takes his biggest swings in terms of cuts to the government since the Republicans control Congress. They will expend political capital to make controversial changes. Therefore, they will focus on their highest priority changes.
   * We have to see what happens to Congress in the 2026 elections. In recent history, Congress has changed power from one political party to another (I believe in 2008 Dems won power under Obama, but then Republicans gained power in 2010). If the Dems win back the balance of power in 2 years, there may not be the political will to privatize. The Dems will sell a fear message around housing affordability, increased costs to borrowers so that they can retain power and control over an important political tool. 

Conclusion

If I were to place odds, it feels feels like a latter-half Trump term initiative. And the best odds are only if Republicans retain power in both houses of Congress in order to pass a bill to make this happen. They're in healthy positions but a couple more years of making money will put them in a financial sweet spot for it to be supported by politicians. 

Even then, it's quite complex and likely is years in the making. But the stock will move if the possibility of privatization in the near term becomes visible. 

If Democrats take power back in Congress in 2026, this isn't a place I'd bent money. Same goes if they win the presidency in 2028. There's also a possibility that the government wants to make major changes to how these types of government-sponsored enterprises are structured, making privatization a much more complicated matter.",11,8,1732642196.0,fnma come back 20262027,0.0
$Dell Earnings ,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

Orange Juice Crisis,"# Overview

There is currently an ongoing orange juice crisis. Here, I explain what is happening in the orange market, and what metrics/information an orange investor should look out for.

# Context: A Perfect Shitstorm of Weather and Disease

Orange juice has become very expensive. So much so, that OJ has been one of the top performers in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (excluding BTC) since 2020. Below is a graphical representation.

https://preview.redd.it/isa4u6bz273e1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&s=4351eccf9b1ea2066b8d282a3907fcc913dd41e5

*Fig 1. Orange Juice Futures (candlestick) vs. major commodities, Crude Oil (Green), Copper (Blue), Gold (Purple), Silver (Mint), Soybeans (Red).*

Since 2020, OJ has risen in price by more than 350%. This dwarfs the performance of other major commodities, some of which had arguably very good runs themselves.

So what exactly happened to OJ? There are two, both of which concern the crop’s supply side: adverse weather events and citrus greening.

First, on adverse weather: climate change is nothing new. As of late, however, the damage done to crops due to extreme weather effects seem to be on the rise both in terms of frequency and intensity. It also just happens so that Brazil was hit the hardest, recording its hottest ever temperature in 2023. This is serious news for OJ, [because Brazil alone supplies 70% of the world market](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/29/orange-juice-makers-consider-other-fruits-prices-bananas-brazil-harvest). Needless to say, extreme heat is never good for crops - for oranges in particular, it significantly increases premature fruit drops, which diminishes yields for plantations.

*Fig 3. Brazil Change in Distribution of Average Maximum Surface Air Temperature, 1951-2020 ; source: World Bank Group. Not only has the average temperature been rising in Brazil, the extremities of droughts are also trending upwards. Extremities are the real crop killers.*

To get the absolutely worst outcome, combine this with a tree disease that has no known cure: citrus greening. Citrus greening causes citrus fruit to stay green instead of ripening, turning it bitter and inedible, and causes the trees to produce less fruit over time. Once a tree is infected, it typically dies within 5-10 years. There is currently no known cure. The disease is also highly contagious. [Virtually all trees in Florida, which used to top even Brazil in OJ production at one time, is infected by citrus greening](https://news.mongabay.com/2024/04/florida-citrus-growers-hope-push-pull-agroecology-method-will-save-their-industry/). Florida barely produces any oranges these days, and most juice makers have already left their groves (Fig 4). As for Brazil, \[Fundecitrus estimated in 2023 that 38% of the plants in the Brazilian citrus belt had symptoms of citrus greening\]([https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:\~:text=The citrus belt%2C however%2C also,have symptoms of the disease.)](https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:~:text=The%20citrus%20belt%2C%20however%2C%20also,have%20symptoms%20of%20the%20disease.)).

*Fig 4. US Domestic Production of Oranges. Florida now makes less than 1/10 of what it used to make just 20 years ago. Most citrus trees died due to citrus greening, and most grove owners never replanted.*

As a result, OJ inventory is currently at historically low levels (Fig 5, Fig 6), which explains the squeeze in its price. [USDA estimated that the 2022-2023 growing season for citrus was the least productive since 1936.](https://www.wusf.org/environment/2023-05-08/20-year-fight-citrus-greening-florida-farmers-researchers-exhausted)

# Future of Orange Juice

So where will the price of OJ be in the next few years? This is where we get into speculative territory, though the most natural response from a degen ape would be to short the hell out of this thing. Before we do so, however, let us look at some reasons why OJ will have no choice but to come down in price.

**(Somewhat) Predictable Nature of the Niño Index**

Extreme heat that damages crops in Southern Brazil (where the citrus belt is located) is almost always accompanied by El Niño. El Niño occurs when the Pacific Ocean near the equator becomes unusually warm, causing global weather disruptions like droughts in some areas and flooding in others. La Niña is the opposite pattern, where the same region of the Pacific becomes cooler than normal, also affecting weather worldwide but generally causing opposite effects in affected regions. These patterns affect the crop conditions for each country differently, based on its geographical location. For Brazil, and the citrus belt in particular, El Niño is the more serious problem, because El Niño generally brings heat while La Niña takes it away.

https://preview.redd.it/7etys2n8373e1.png?width=2498&format=png&auto=webp&s=6baeac6f66db2abbd2b3f8a236c72d8609153882

*Fig 7. Niño Index; source: Golden Gate Weather Services. Just from a glance, the index seems to closely resemble a normal distribution. Extreme events happen at lower frequencies than less extreme events, and the index oscillates between El Niño and La Niña in a predictable pattern.*

Heat was a greater contributor than citrus greening in lowering Brazil's citrus production in the 2022-2023 growing season (CitrusBR). This means that as long as we don't see another very strong El Niño in the near future, we can be assured of successful orange harvests in Brazil. Based on historical data (Fig 7), the Niño index seems to follow a normal distribution, with La Niña usually following strong El Niños. Given the fact that we just had a very strong El Niño in 2023, there seems to be a slim chance of another one happening within the next few years.

If this is true, a cooler temperature in Brazil for the next 1-3 years should increase output and put downward pressure back on the price of OJ. Strong caveat: nobody can forecast the weather with 100% accuracy. That is why I say 'somewhat'. But the math seems grounded, and nature at least mean-reverting.

**Substitution Effect**

We can also rely on macroeconomic forces to make forecasts.

OJ is not a need. It is also has many substitutes. Consumers have a variety of juices to choose from in the supermarket. If OJ is too expensive, they can easily buy apple or grapefruit juice. Moreover, [retail juice makers (e.g., coca-cola) are looking to use alternative fruits like mandarins to produce their orange juice](https://www.newsweek.com/companies-may-stop-using-oranges-make-orange-juice-1905954).

Therefore, in the long-term, even in the unlikely scenario where the citrus supply shock never recovers, high prices for OJ will drive demand down, ultimately leading to a lower price. High price is the cure for high prices for goods that have clear substitutes and are not Veblen.

**Potential Cure for Citrus Greening**

[Scientists in Florida may have found the cure for citrus greening.](https://theconversation.com/trees-own-beneficial-microbiome-could-lead-to-discovery-of-new-treatments-to-fight-citrus-greening-disease-232681) However, the work is only preliminary and more time and tests will be needed to prove its efficacy.

# Notes on Trading OJ

OJ can be shorted on ICE Futures. 1pt move on an OJ contract translates to a $150 P/L. Current price of OJ is 513.10. The average price of OJ pre-supply shock was approximately 130. Assuming that the current price reverts back to the mean, an investor can therefore expect to make a profit of $57,450 with a \~$20k maintenance margin per contract. The actual profit will most likely be lower, however, because of the big spreads in OJ (OJ is not a liquid contract) and rollover risk. Still, OJ presents a good opportunity for speculators at this point in time, for reasons mentioned above.

RedCat DD,"I’m back with the RedCat DD that I promised. 

RedCat is an American Drone company that, as of last week, has been chosen as the sole provider of small, rucksack portable, attritable drones bringing surveillance and strike capabilities, to none other than the United States Army. 

Through a program of record initiated 5 years ago, Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), the US Army was able to test, research, evaluate and compare capabilities/limitations of drones from 37 companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the “reigning champion” from SRR tranche 1, Skydio. They also fielded these drones in Ukraine to determine resistance to electronic warfare and signal jamming in combat against a modernized and “competent” near peer adversary. Needless to say, RedCat provided a far superior drone, purpose built for the warfighter and was subsequently chosen as the contract winner. 

“Oh it’s one little Army contract for around 12,000 drones, how is that important?”

Great question, looks like not everyone in this sub rides the short bus to school. 

As mentioned previously, SRR testing began in 2018. Now who was paying attention to something other than the big red line that was your portfolio in 2022? Just 4 years after the Army identified the potential viability of drones in wartime? Yep, you got it. Russia invaded Ukraine. Here’s a sticker for you to add to your helmet. If you haven't been watching the drone footage from the Ukrainian war, you should probably get on that. 

Drones have completely changed the battlefield. Ukrainian forces are currently using/losing at LEAST 10,000 drones a month, with some 30,000+ drones in the air everyday. To reiterate, 5 years ago, before Russia invaded Ukraine, before drones were proven in combat, before Ukraine was burning through 10,000 a month to fight one of our near peers, the Army decided they would like about 12,000. 

Do the math. Do you believe the largest and most powerful land force on Earth would order 2 weeks worth of drones and call it good? You know the answer to this question. Why don’t you have free medical care? Why do you have 100k in student loans? Why will an ambulance ride bankrupt you?

Fantastic, you’re right again. 13.3% of the US Federal budget goes straight to the DOD. A cool $820 billion. I’m sure you’re losing focus but I’m certain your wife’s boyfriend can keep her company for a little bit longer. Now add this one up. If you are engaged in conflict with another world power, where do you want to put your money? Do you want to buy the 50k drone that can target anything from the sky, completely unmanned, or do you want to spend 10 million on a single M1 Abrams tank that will take a critical hit from an FPV attack drone, killing the entire crew? 

Let me say this another way. You are America and will stop at nothing to maintain your position as the superior global superpower. Are you buying 5 tanks or 1,000 drones? 1,300 drones or a single F-18? 13,000 drones or 10 F-18’s? How about raising taxes and buying both.

I am not the Secretary of Defense but I can assume an intricate cost benefit analysis is being conducted by US military leadership. In the very near future, the DOD will be acquiring more than 12,000 drones, a whole lot more. 

In case you aren’t aware, the US Army is America’s largest branch of the armed forces. This means they have more money to R&D than their counterparts. With some second level thinking you can understand this to mean if another branch of the military can wait for a wealthier branch to spend millions/billions finding the best product, and buy it after they do, they’ll do exactly that. This reality extends beyond the American DOD. 

How about Australia? Here’s a start. 

https://ir.redcatholdings.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/158/red-cat-to-supply-flightwave-edge-130-blue-systems-to-royal-australian-navy

“Red Cat to Supply FlightWave Edge 130 Blue Systems to Royal Australian Navy”

I hypothesize allied armed forces have been patiently awaiting the conclusion of big Army’s testing to determine where they will also be sourcing their combat drones. SRR is really only the beginning. 

For those interested in semiconductor plays that also understand the importance of Taiwan, you might want to give these articles a read. 

https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-09/news/us-supply-taiwan-attack-drones

https://news.usni.org/2024/07/01/hellscape-swarms-could-be-as-cost-effective-taiwan-defense-says-report

The future of warfare is unmanned systems fighting other unmanned systems. Why did we leave Vietnam? Unpopularity back home, moms had enough of losing their sons. How long can America sustain a war outspending USD? When America’s cost of war is cheap drones instead of billions and American lives, we might just deter our adversaries in a way they don’t want to engage us anyways. 

That leads me to the next point. Drones as a deterrence factor. How many drones operating autonomously in a swarm is enough? How many does the entire DOD need on hand? How many do our allies want? 100,000? 200,000? A million? How many combat drones do you speculate that America’s military industrial complex wants on hand? I can’t give you a definitive answer so unfortunately you’ll have to take a quick break from licking that window and use your own reasoning skills. I can say, however, that I’m pretty confident about where they will be sourcing these drones.

Now, enough “market” analysis. Let’s talk about some numbers. u/CynicalMelody was kind enough to post this on a previous post of mine the other day.

“Here is my prediction Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations
Current Market Capitalization: $708.997 million

Current Stock Price: $9.39

Shares Outstanding: Approximately 75.5 million

Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue: $100 million

Industry Revenue Multiple: 20× annual revenue

Implied Valuation:

Implied Market Capitalization: $100 million × 20 = $2 billion

Implied Stock Price: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately $26.49 per share

Potential Upside: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately 182% increase”

This analysis does not include what will be awarded in the future. 

The stock market is forward looking. Now look forward so you can get an edge. The US drone industry is currently estimated to be worth around 3.94B, expected to increase to 8.65B by 2034. 

https://www.precedenceresearch.com/military-drones-market#:~:text=Military%20Drones%20Market%20Size%2C%20Share,7.95%25%20between%202024%20and%202034

Sure maybe the American drone industry will only double over the next 10 years, the thing is, all bets are off if/when we go to war. Where will that money go? 

If you believe global tensions are rising and war is imminent, where is your capital going to be safest? This is your opportunity to build some conviction. How will the US stock market hold up if we go to war? Individual companies? How about if we don’t? Answer those same questions but with RedCat. We get sucked in and large scale war begins, VOO -25%, RCAT +60%. Place your bets.

By current business prospects, RCAT is criminally undervalued. It should have traded at $12 the moment the SRR winner was announced. Also, is there a more reliable source of consistent payments/business than providing services to the US military/government?

This image was not my work, but here is some price modeling data.



If you can buy cheaper than $12, you’re getting a deal. If you understand the gravity of the SRR win, there is much more to follow. This is a chance to buy something that you would hold for a year. Most of yall have never heard the word “profits” so taxes isn’t a problem for you, but for the 6 people in here that aren’t regarded, this is a play you can hold for a year and pay long term capital gains on your gains. Buy calls, exercise them or sell them, buy shares keep them, whatever you wanna do. This company is promising with a bright future. I do apologize that I didn’t post this earlier. I have been working with the mods to get this posted as soon as it was allowed. (Until a few days ago it’s been under 500M market cap. Wanted and tried to post DD back in July)

"$CBL: The Shopping REIT that Screws Banks and Has 2-3x Upside to Comps
","***TL;DR at Bottom for my ADHD brethren.***

CBL is playing 4D chess in the retail REIT game. Unlike the high majority retail REITS I’ve seen, it has non-recourse loans. What does that mean? It means that if a property isn’t pulling its weight, they just toss the keys back to the lender and walk away. To simplify:

1. CBL buys a property with loans (like a mortgage)
2. Property works out - CBL wins
3. Property doesn’t work out - CBL can simply walk away and the bank takes the property, but ***cannot go after other assets!*** CBL only loses what they put in (analogous to down payment... not a huge L)

This is combined with some excellent operational performance compared with peers. Depending on what comp you use, it seems like CBL could fairly be 2-3x higher in stock price. It has **better** operating metrics and ROIC:

https://preview.redd.it/cpx617lh763e1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=119457849d20a7ace07d57e732056d0040ab4f46

*So, if it’s so great, who owns it?*

Well, there’s 64.5% insider ownership… this is insanely high so management and insiders like Oaktree (Howard Marks) think it looks good. But this has a side effect that is negative for exposure: it also makes the float low, so institutions can’t easily buy in. But to solve this problem, CBL is using its 17% cash flow yield to buy back shares. They've nuked 8% of the float in buybacks this past year which means there is significant upward buying pressure. 

So essentially, this company has emerged from distress having offloaded shitty properties, and is now printing cash, buying back shares, and bullying lenders. There are several catalysts on the near horizon:

1. Lowered interest rates are pure fuel for this company, so if the economy shows softness, which it has, rates will come down even more and help it.
2. The company recently has had great momentum (+10% in past month) and this indicates more and more interest.
3. New buybacks likely will be announced at next earnings in Feb

*Here’s what makes it especially interesting. As far as I can tell, sh-rts were fairly lazy and just thought:*

“Hmm, this is some random shopping mall REIT, hurr durr let’s sell it. Plus, it emerged from bankruptcy, it must have had bad performance… yep hurr durr” 

This has led to 16% SI which is very significant for this sector.

If you are generally concerned with this play, I would recommend considering a pair trade by shorting one of the other, lesser performing REITs, which should get rid of most sector risk. Then you sit around and wait. Management is insanely aligned with you, the company is on fire, and it’s going to get even better if rates lower. In the meantime, you enjoy cash being thrown off and shares being bought back.

I bought calls that expire after the next FOMC, which should be a good catalyst if they lower rates. I’ve been banking so far:

$PCT (Purecycle) is on the prowl and ready to explode. Get in while you can,"So you're rolling in money from AsSTiTs, $RKLB, and $ACHR. You're too scared to YOLO into $MSTR. $PCT is now at a similar stage as when AsSTiTs had their first test satellite in the air or Archer first flew their eVTOL. They've shown it can work; now comes the commercialization and scaling.

PureCycle has invented a revolutionary new way to recycle plastic. Most plastic you put in the recycle bin today [gets burned or thrown away](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/california-sues-exxonmobil-plastic-recycling-deception-rcna172267). They've finally figured out a way to actually re-use this shit (recycle symbol #5) and are scaling up production and signing contrats right now, just so you can get in on the ground floor. Other brands want their product because it makes them look good to their customers that they're using recycled plastic, and it's cheaper too I'm pretty sure.

*1. The Technology*

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018)

These guys have been dropping corporate hype videos in recent weeks because they're finally getting cocky that their shit works. I'm honestly not exactly sure what's happening here, but it seems like the new plastic they're making in their Ohio factory is pure as hell.

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911)

Here's another video from today of their CEO flexing their facility in Denver which apparently sources old plastic to make the new plastic. Again not entirely sure what I'm looking at here, but [this guy is a dawg and lives for this shit](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988), which is what you want in a CEO. My takeaway is they finally are getting quality old plastic to make into elite new plastic, at scale.

They also have a sick new R&D facility in North Carolina to learn how to keep churning out purer and purer product.

*2. Commercial Demand*

This tech was actually made by P&G and licensed to PureCycle to scale. P&G is their first customer. In addition, [according to their 10-Q](https://ir.purecycle.com/sec-filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000950170-24-127556/0000950170-24-127556.pdf), ""PureCycle has allocated 40% of the Augusta Facility output, for Lines 1 and 2, to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be negotiated."" I'm pretty sure that means that for their second factory in Georgia, they already have 40% of sales made and are actively working on the rest.

Now that the tech works, their focus this year and Q1/Q2 2025 is commercialization. This is the time to get in, because once they announce those juicy contracts, this thing is gone.

To be clear, this is a risky pre-revenue growth company so scaling is not guaranteed. However, it finally seems to be de-risked enough from a technology standpoint, and the deals they're making now show this.

*3. Financials*

[Their ex-CFO said they were modeling their profit margins to be 40-60%.](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988) They're taking shit that people don't want and would actually pay to get rid of and making it useful. They still may need to raise more shares to fund all their build out.

Short interest is high but the price is on an up trend. They will eventually need to cover.

Archer (ACHR): Over $6 and Counting—The Journey is Far from Over 🚀,"**Alright everbody, let’s talk about where we’re at with ACHR:**

Since my first post back in October, Archer has climbed **over 100%** and now sits above **$6**. The steep incline has been exciting, but the journey is far from over. Here’s a look at what’s been happening. We’ve got major news, strong forecasts, and institutional backing that keep this play looking solid. Let me break it down:

**Analyst Price Target are Bullish**  
Analysts are projecting an **average price target of $9.69,** with some forecasts reaching as high as **$13.12**. New coverage from Needham just slapped a **Buy** rating on it. The trajectory? Upward.

**381 Funds are on Board**  
Institutional interest in ACHR is growing, with **381 funds** now holding positions—up 8.55% last quarter. Total shares owned by institutions increased by over **10%**, showing confidence in Archer’s growth. Big money sees the potential.

**Insider Activity & Growing Buzz**  
Insider transactions over the past 12 months show strong confidence from within the company:

* **7 insider buys** totaling **28.7M shares**, with only **3 sells** amounting to **3.2M shares**.
* In the last 6 months alone, there were **3 insider buys** totaling over **20M shares**.

This aligns with the momentum we’ve seen recently, with a flood of news, analyst ratings, and community discussions driving ACHR into the spotlight. The buzz isn’t just from the outside, people on the inside clearly see the potential too.

**Major NYC News**  
Archer’s partner **Skyports Infrastructure** and **Groupe ADP** have been selected to operate the **Downtown Manhattan Heliport**, a key move toward bringing electric air taxis to NYC. Together with **United Airlines**, the plan is to electrify the heliport and introduce quieter, cleaner, and more affordable urban air mobility for New Yorkers. This is a massive step forward.

**Global Expansion & Commercialization Strategy**  
Archer’s plans go beyond the U.S., they’re actively positioning themselves for deployment in the **Middle East, Asia, and India**, with key partnerships already in place. Their three-step commercialization strategy is set to begin as early as next year:

1. **Piloted demonstration flights** in key markets.
2. **Market survey trips** carrying passengers on initial air taxi routes.
3. **Full-scale commercial operations** post-certification.

India, with its large urban markets, is shaping up to be one of Archer’s biggest opportunities, supported by their partnership with **InterGlobe Enterprises**.

**Production Facility Nearing Completion**  
Archer’s new manufacturing facility is set to open in the coming weeks. This factory will begin producing **type-design aircraft** next year, ramping up to a production rate of **two aircraft per month by the end of 2025**, with plans to scale even further in 2026. This marks a significant step toward real-world operations and commercial readiness.

**The Journey Continues**  
For those already in, congrats on riding this wave. For those still watching, it’s not too late. After such a strong climb, while some might expect a pullback, in my view, consolidations aren’t guaranteed. Momentum has been holding steady, and the recent news flow has only strengthened the outlook. Even if there are minor dips, there’s no reason to get nervous. Let the doubters and short sellers be the ones sweating it out and reaching for the aspirin. With upcoming milestones like pilot flights and the manufacturing facility launch, the **short-term** and **long-term** potential both look strong.

**TL;DR:** ACHR is up over 100% but still has room to run. NYC, institutional backing, and bullish price targets are lining up to make this a big winner. The ride isn’t over yet, join if you’re ready to see what’s next. 🚀

MSTR Has An Infinite Money Glitch,"Sorry if someone already talked about how this really works. But let's get into the details here on why MSTR is able to get 0% loans on billions every time they do a debt offering. Many people are wondering what kind of morons are buying 0% convertible notes from MSTR. After all, there is a reasonable chance MSTR goes bankrupt if BTC has a sustained bear market around the time these notes mature. And a company like this, you'd expect double digit interest on a loan.

But of course, these are convertible notes. The most recent offering is convertible at \~$670 per share if my napkin math is correct. So they are essentially a 0% loan with a free $670 2028 call option. It turns out, that call option is incredibly valuable. Don't take my word for it, just check the market.

According to Yahoo Finance, a $700 MSTR Jan-2027 call traded around $230-240 on Friday. A Jan-2026 $700 call traded around $185. So you'd expect a 2028 $700 call should be worth nearly $300. So just by buying the note, you're getting about $300 worth of call options per share. You can instantly hedge this position by selling the 2027 call and grabbing $240. This sets up the following scenarios...

1. MSTR goes above $700, your call buyer exercises, you convert your debt to equity to cover the exercise, you net $700 per share + $230 call, you are out the $670/share you used from your principal to convert. You have a gain of $260 on $670 initial for a profit of 38.8%, which takes a maximum of 3 years (expiry of the call option) to materialize.
2. Your call buyer never exercises, you hold through to expiry, you now have your initial investment & keep the full option premium you sold @ $230 per share. You still have 1y+ until your convertible note expires, meaning you can potentially sell another call for added ROI. You pocket $230 for every $670 invested for a gain of 34.3% in 3 years. Eventually the note matures and you get back your initial investment, MSTR is not bankrupt.
3. MSTR goes tits up sometime around 2028. You get to keep the option premium you sold of course, and you will probably recover something from the bankruptcy as well being an unsecured creditor, unless BTC goes to below 10K or something. You'd expect to get back 50-100% of your initial investment with the loan and option premium.

With this in mind, all you need to do is assign probabilities to each outcome. Clearly the financial world thinks that these are a good play. They are able to do this because the IV on their stock is absolutely bananas. This makes their call options incredibly valuable. MSTR is trading volatility for cash. And people are lining up to participate.

So long as the stock remains volatile, which seems likely, they can keep issuing more of these notes and people will be lining around the block to buy them. Meanwhile, they are using the cash to buy BTC which puts huge upward pressure on the market, and subsequently pumps their stock, and creates even more demand for their notes.

Does this end poorly? Probably. But for now the music is playing, and we all have to dance.",825,319,1732525561.0,mstr infinite money glitch,0.0

PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one. **The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all **points back to one fundamental goal** of the company's management: **manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are **not** part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:** In a **direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is **no lock-up period** (common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6–12 months). This approach ensures a **larger float** right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the **first week** of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company’s market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted Market Cap=Share Price×Free Float Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the “effective float” rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by [investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically [buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",1823,356,1732505208.0,pltr said quiet part loud dd,0.0

🔋 Bloom Energy’s 95% Run: The Hidden Energy Play Behind AI Data Centers,"**Bloom Energy (BE) surged 59% on Nov 15 and is now up 95%.**  
While it’s unclear if the rally will pause or continue—and you should be mindful that, as I just said, she has already soared 95%—this post explores why this move is more than a short-term trend, with highly significant catalysts on the horizon.

[Bloom Energy servers](https://preview.redd.it/j6j1akk2x43e1.jpg?width=3912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb781f61de55753b16b0ff00433654d603615d53)

AI is booming, and it’s not a fad. Have you heard of NVDA? Of course you have, and you know the demand for its semiconductors is insane. Here are key insights from last Wednesday’s NVDA earnings call:

* Hopper demand is exceptional.
* Blackwell demand is staggering.
* NVDA is racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand.
* The next wave of AI is Enterprise AI and Industrial AI.

\-----

AI isn’t just the future—it’s here and scaling rapidly. These semiconductors are being used to build advanced data centers. **But to turn on these data centers, you cannot just plug all that processing power into the wall outlet. They require specialized power setups from their local energy utility.**

Connecting a data center to the grid requires major upgrades due to their immense energy demands and need for reliability:

**Dedicated Substations:** Data centers need substations with high-capacity transformers and switchgear to step down grid power. Building or upgrading a substation can take 2–3 years due to permitting, engineering, and construction delays.

**Transmission Line Upgrades:** High-voltage lines may need new installations, conductor upgrades, or pole reinforcements, often delayed by land acquisition, environmental reviews, and public opposition.

**Distribution Network Enhancements:** Local networks require upgrades like redundant feeders, voltage regulators, and new lines to ensure stable delivery from substations to data centers.

**Redundancy and Reliability:** To meet 99.999% uptime demands, utilities need to build costly redundant systems, including backup transmission lines and ring configurations, to eliminate single points of failure.

Furthermore, data centers consume immense amounts of electricity, often beyond what utilities can supply. Slow by nature, utilities are vastly unprepared for the AI-driven demand surge, and they are struggling to respond.

Besides, upgrading grid infrastructure requires billions of dollars and takes years, with delays from zoning, public consultations, and environmental reviews. As a result, companies that want to develop their data centers face growing waiting lists for power, risking their competitive edge in an industry where delays of even months can be critical.

**This isn’t hypothetical—it’s happening now.** I’ve included several sources and citations at the end.

\-----

Enter Bloom Energy ($BE), which sells on-site power generators that can run data centers **without relying on the grid**—a proven solution used for years in hospitals, factories, and off-grid installations.

On Nov 14 (after-hours), American Electric Power (AEP), a major utility that operates in 11 states and is struggling to meet data center energy demands, struck a deal with Bloom Energy. Instead of making clients wait years or relocate, AEP will offer Bloom’s energy servers, enabling data centers to power up in months, not years, and stay competitive.

This is a game-changer for Bloom Energy. They’ve shifted from selling servers to individual clients to partnering with utility giant AEP—a move from retail to wholesale.

Bloom’s technology isn’t new, but the AEP deal marks a leap to scalable, utility-scale partnerships, unlocking massive demand.

\-----

A company wanting to develop a data center: “I need energy for my data center!”  
AEP: “We’ll be able to accommodate you until mid-2027. You can wait, move to a location where the grid is already upgraded (but you need to hurry because those spaces are limited), or we can install these Bloom Energy servers and you’ll have your energy in 90 days.”

For those who grasp this jump from retail to wholesale, the opportunity is clear.  
Careful, though. My entry was over a week ago, and she has been running a lot already. However, every new AEP order or, fingers crossed, any other major utility signing a new agreement with Bloom Energy? Wink emoji.

Do your own research, though. And for those who want to dive deeper into the details, here are the sources I used to inform my play:

Joby vs Archer ,"I usually avoid airline stocks, but their ideas, aircraft and contracts make it worth looking into.

To me Joby is far ahead of archer. They alphabet contracts with Toyota and Uber. 

Archer does have contracts with united which does seem like it will make things easier for FAA.

Jobys aircraft also seems like it has more going for it.

Will $NVCR have a rebound?,"The company produces medical devices to treat cancer in a novel way, using ""Tumor Treating Fields"". First product was a helmet, for brain tumors. It's a niche. No other company do the same. Competition is ""classical"" medical approaches.

Company isn't profitable, but revenues keep growing.

They are exploring new products, for treating more types of cancers. They had a failed trial for ovarian cancer, which caused a major drop in stock price. They got FDA approval recently for a type of lung cancer. Other products are in trials.

COIN - The Exchange for an Asset Class People No Longer Trade?,"What's the rationale for COIN at these levels?

Would seem to me:

1. Their revenues from trading are getting smoked down 27% last quarter?. Crypto is clearly not a ""transactional"" asset class anymore.
2. Even if stablecoin volume is huge - surely the USA is the wrong place to host such a venue/stock as the path forward for stablecoins. They say $20trillion in stable has transacted this year already - but people will not pay a premium to move money around for legimate purchases when banks/Wise/whatever do this almost for free. Theres a lot of volume as people accumulate positions - but its not clear why they would continue to use this if the platform required any meaningful fee.
3. Impossible to have much of a moat in a deregulated world (assuming #2 is wrong) in which case the trade to be long the only place in town to ""do"" crypto is pretty played out.
4. Even given all that, the company just doesn't make much money. There will be some revaluation due to their bitcoin portfolio and a flurry of MSTR vs XBT convergence trades - but beyond that its hard to see an exchange doing well where volumes are in decline.

So they trade 80x+ forward PE and even those estimates look pretty fanciful on the earnings side. So (as with MSTR) theres room to get smoked if the bull run continues in Crypto (in which case would seem being long bitcoin is better than COIN) - but **if the music pauses for a couple minutes, then surely COINs ability to collect tendies is pretty limited as people no longer really 'trade' crypto pairs - just stagnant insto/whales holding a larger and larger share of the only remaining crypto asset that matters.**",0,18,1732634965.0,coin exchange asset class people longer trade,0.3612
$MARA DD - The MaraStrategy 💊,"📢Preface

Disclaimer: I use a cringe amount of emoji 🫣 also the following is not not financial advice. If you lose money that's too bad, you gain a life lesson.

Illiterate? => Scroll to the bottom, follow instructions 👇

Disclosure: As of Nov 22nd I have \~8k in various $MARA calls + some additional funds to buy $MARA stock on dips. I will instantly buy more if Fred Thiel keeps employing the ""MaraStrategy""

Most of this DD focuses on $MARA compared to $MSTR, I compared multiple tickers before determining $MARA was the best play.

With that out of the way, lets dive into the always sunny bull case for $MARA  
\---

💊MaraStrategy

For this section please humor me by assuming it is near impossible for $BTC to go down and it just continues going up. Think: 'sToNkS oNlY gO uP' type shit 😌

Thanks to the pioneers and investors in MicroStrategy an asymmetrical opportunity has presented itself. $MARA or Marathon Digital Holdings mines bitcoin and holds bitcoin, a shit-ton of it. In fact its the largest mining company by market cap with the largest $BTC holdings after $MSTR.

The ""MaraStrategy"" (codename: 💊) is an ambitious prospect of acquiring, holding and utilizing $BTC. Basically borrowing money against its holdings to buy $BTC and in turn providing that investment opportunity to its shareholders. $MSTR CEO Michael Saylor has derived this creative business model that is pushing both industry and the world at large into securing $BTC holdings. A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind, highly recommend listening to his vision for bitcoin from interviews on youtube.

$MARA happens to be in the best position to replicate what $MSTR is doing.  
\- They have plenty of expertise and experience within the sector.  
\- A forward thinking CEO (s/o Fred👋) who has already began executing the MicroStrategy model.  
\- One of the strongest mining operations.  
\- Fresh infrastructure investment prepped for halving.  
\- A growing reputation of HODLing $BTC.  

So why not just buy $MSTR? ""They were first!"" They will come out on top... right? Yes and no. They are currently utilizing their $BTC holdings better than anyone else. However, the $BTC value per share would be reduced if everyone just kept buying in, driving it higher as shares are diluted. $MSTR still has to pay their ""debts"" over time (which is crucial because $BTC takes time to go up \[I'm simplifying this slightly\]). Plus their option premiums are pricey 😤

We are starting to see other companies switching from purely fiat currency to diversified holdings with $BTC, daily.

To be clear I am not saying $MSTR is done running at all. My conviction is simply that $MARA presents an asymmetrical opportunity to get (fuck you) money from (irresponsible) option positions because it is an early adopter of the same strategy and is currently wildly undervalued by comparison 🤑

Hopefully you kept in mind what I said about $BTC not going down, it helps understand the premise.  
Also its true (facts no cap on god frfr), $BTC is just going to keep rising, its inevitable. Although if it has a big dipperino all this goes to shit... but its a bull market so we're throwing caution to the wind 🙃  
\---

🤯Catalysts

If I can ask you to only read and consider one of these, really have a deep think 🧠 on the first one, the rest are bonuses:

₿itcoin - I was a skeptic years ago, now adoption is imminent. Bitcoin is the world's reserve currency. The biggest catalyst of all is the value of $BTC and the fact it's being adopted by EVERY person, EVERY business and EVERY country. The people drove the companies to invest and the companies are driving the countries to invest. Read it again. It's a rich man's world and they are going to want to ensure their wealth is secured. Without getting into the weeds you have to acknowledge fiat currency is inferior in some ways. Bitcoin's monetary value fluctuates, its use-cases expand but fundamentally its societal value is static and has remained intact since manifestation. No one knows what price $BTC is going to but I bet my dick it's much higher than 100k 🚀

Continued aggressive purchasing of $BTC, the sooner the better. Fred Theil needs to show he's committed to following the MaraStrategy model. Then he needs to utilize the holdings to purchase against for more $BTC and to expand operations because the main business needs to also benefit from the increased holding for shareholder value.

Investors flooding in from both retail and institutional have been a huge driving factor of bitcoins positive price action. It is easier to access bitcoin now because you don't have to directly buy $BTC, $MSTR, $IBIT and now $MARA give simple, cheap and liquid ways to diversify in $BTC as fiat currency loses some ""market share"" to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin commonly held by public companies/governments like the transition from paper to software it is undoubtedly going to be a critical investment in the future and holding out means losing out. Especially for public companies where cash holdings are scrutinized, do you really believe undiversified cash reserves are going to remain competitive? Chew on this, $BTC has increased in value as fiat currencies are depreciating and we have seen $MSTR has been outperforming a majority of companies, less than a year ago it was valued at less than 10B now its valued 10x higher at nearly 100B, they have 33B in $BTC alone. This isn't some small cap ssq run up, it's leveraged to the tits 🫦 but its achieving incredible value.

Infinite Money Glitch 🤯 $BTC goes up, which means $MARA's holdings go up, profits per coin from mining goes up, stock goes up, allows them to buy more $BTC, $BTC goes up ♻️ $MARA has the perfect supporting business for this they are literally PRINTING MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, must be funny.

There is a critical mass where companies and countries all start jumping in, buying $BTC and that causes $BTC to go fucking parabolic and $MARA to go marabolic -- its about to be a goddamn gold rush and picks ⛏️ are on sale.

Small positives but worth noting  
\- Mining stocks are finally catching up to $BTC giving some extra momentum and volume  
\- China does the most mining in the world and its courts just confirmed $BTC is property and therefore is now legal for cities to own.  
\- With all Crypto rising $MARA can also mine other coins if it makes sense, they have pivoted before to coins providing better financial value.  
\- Saylor just tweeted ""$MARA is a company on the #Bitcoin Standard."" We have Daddy's approval 😏  
 \---

🤓Numbers

I had break my 🚫 no math on weekends rule to write this, ain't it sad?

I am only going to go over $MARA compared to $MSTR, they have the most bitcoins and $MSTR is $MARA's biggest competitor. Numbers are from Nov 21st, assume a $BTC value of 98k. Premium calculations are taken from u/Jazzlike_Record_8915 on Reddit, they obviously fluctuate daily but I am just using them to illustrate a point.

While the value of $MSTR is derived 99% from its $BTC holdings essentially making it just a proxy, $MARA has an operational business valued at $3B so lets factor that in to calculate the premium paid per Bitcoin.

Holdings Value (Bitcoin):  
\- $MARA $3.191B - $MSTR $32.457B  
   
Gross Equity (Operating Company Value):  
\- $MARA $6.391B - $MSTR $32.957B  
   
Net Equity (After Debt):  
\- $MARA $4.972B - $MSTR 24B  
   
Market Cap:  
\- $MARA $7.92B - $MSTR $117B  
   
Premium per share:  
\- $MARA 1.59x - $MSTR 4.87x  
   
Implied price per $BTC  
\- $MARA $156k - $MSTR $477k

🤔 156k vs 477k per $BTC

Ahaaaaahh! Do you like paying a 3x higher premium? I mean that shits just gonna keep inflating but my boy Fred, over at Marathon Digital Holdings, he's putting his business to work.

Last report states $MARA mined 717 $BTC in Oct, thats > 23 a day and \~8.6k $BTC a year. If they didn't purchase a single bitcoin for a year their holding would still grow 20% from mining alone 🌱

Value wise there is no doubt $MARA > $MSTR.  
\---

📊Technical Analysis

The charts look fucking glorious, full on 🐂ish, every chart in the market is pointing to $BTC rising. I only know how to do bargain bin TA for short term moves, check this guy out for the yearly picture, hes a freaking 🧙‍♂️ at calling movement before it happens.  
[https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518](https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518)  
In his latest $MARA analysis he notes it to be incredibly bullish as it breaks above the current level ($24) toward $41 and if it can reach that it has a chance to really run ($100+), only 6 mins long and very thorough.  
\---

😮‍💨Conclusion

$MARA so hot right now 🥵

My apologies if the DD was a bit cooked, between the Twisted Teas and my self diagnosed ADHD, shit took a lot more time than I expected but it was worth it. If you want a better DD look at the $MSTR ones and apply the thesis, same same. Also I hand wrote this myself, no chatgpt, the least you could do is buy the stock or leave a fuckin' comment eh 🫵🧐  
\---

✊How to Play - Buy, Hold, Repeat.

In my dreams I have a plan, my conviction is that $MARA hits at least $120 in 2025, but I'm not stopping there.  
You can try swing trading this shit but the moves will happen fast and sometimes in the pre-market, I think B&H is better.

Plays ordered by highest profit potential:  
\- 💎Buy options now, make the maximum on degenerate bets, rinse, repeat, reinvest - 20x your portfolio.  
\- 💰Wait until $MARA starts deviating more from $MSTR and other mining companies, buy stock & 1 month out options and keep rolling profits into shares.  
\- 💵Buy stock now, take 25% out every time it doubles: $50, $75, $100, $125  
\- 🤡Wait until its too late.

"RKLB 260116c7, sell or exercise?","Ok, I’m still new to options and even newer to leaps. Back in Aug 19, I bought 4 RKLB 7$ leaps in retirement account. While they are nicely up, they are not as up as I would expect from an option which underlying stocks is up 300% in the same time frame. I think I bought a very bad leap contract, that cost me almost half of the security price hence my leverage is less than 2x on these leaps. Now I wonder what should I do with it. Initially I was planing to just exercise it if RKLB mooned. Well, it’s already mooned. But when I do math it seems that I will gain more shares if I sell leaps and just buy stocks on all proceeds plus money required to exercise it. 

Here is math:
Sell leaps for 7k and buy ~306 shares at current price (23$). Buy another 120 shares @23$ for additional 2800$ that would have been required to exercise these leaps. In the end, I will have 426 shares instead of 400 if I were just to exercise these options for the same extra 2800$. Does it make sense? 

Important detail, this is my retirement account so no taxes. If it were in taxable account, exercising would been the only viable option. ",8,26,1732548803.0,rklb 260116c7 sell exercise,0.0
Redwire (Hands in Every Pot),"My Bull Reasoning for Redwire

So some people have asked what’s the bull case or where Redwire has to grow. Below is a cumulative list in no particular order of my opinion. I’ve been in as low as $4, sold a fair share mid 7s but then loaded up in the $8 when I realized it wasn’t going down again and haven’t sold a share since then. I’ve done the same with rocket lab and this company is another sleeping monster. 
Again I fully feel it’s better to dca or at least do low level limit orders in order to not drive the price too high too fast. (I’m still dcaing at almost 14,000 shares) Note if you’re trying to get in I highly recommend you get what you can prior to Trump signing executive orders. No you don’t need to load up all in one day but stress manufacturing in space will be a priority for the Trump administration. 

1. Pilbox- market for it just in the pilboxes alone and as well as royalties from the crystals grown and other experiments within it. HIV market is alone 34 billion TAM. Bristol myers and eli lilly are two companies we partnered with and they are one of the heavy leaders in that field. Could expect millions annually if drug crystals grown in space show the purity levels that the chemists expect. Multiple avenues here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VttNK2UuY_w

2A. 3D bio printing- Goal is for organs which could be 7-10 years away pending how these next experiments go. Ultimate goal is manufacturing a full heart which costs 2 million alone for a donated heart (check the amount on the waiting list to receive a heart) over 3,000. Even 300 hearts a year you’re looking at over $600 million a year(I imagine a heart tailored to not be rejected would cost maybe 5-10 million)There are other applications they are trying to pursue as well with their 3d bio printing.(Knee, valves, heart patches etc) 

2B. They could potentialy grow human tissues for drug and cosmetic testing, which could in turn render animal testing obsolete. That's great news for the animals, but on a financial note this could be huge, as it could accelerate bringing drugs to market as one important and costly development step could be skipped by going straight to human testing on printed tissues.

2C. Microgravity research and manufacturing includes semiconductors, agricultural, life support, etc https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/new-redwire-investigations-launching-on-spx-31-include-crystallization-and-plant-experiments-to-improve-life-on-earth-and-expand-humanitys-presence-in-space/

3. VLEO- look up darpa with their otter program. Phase four, epl and redwire has been awarded contracts for this. Phase Four and Redwire received the most. Budget from DARPA for this year is 25 million, 2025 increased to -62 million with 2026 expected to be increased two fold again as we will be getting into the operation phase. For Europe we have SKIMSAT and Phantom. 

4. Valkyrie Hall effect thrusters - Huge market for this. Redwire partnering with Phase Four on the developing of these…multiple applications. Full rate production starting 2025.

5. Link 16 - Redwire has the best link 16 antennas on the market. Even though there are some issues the FCC has, link 16 is too important for national security to pull away from. This market will only be increasing. https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/sda-completes-another-major-link-16-testing-milestone-with-successful-space-to-ship-demonstration/Currently subcontracted by York Space Systems and Rocket Lab.

6. Overseas market - I see some huge potential with Dubai and some other European markets. Redwire recently won a contract/grant from ESA for robotic arm development. 

7. Redwires software line- not just hardware but they provide software to nasa and other space agencies. Veritrek for thermal analysis and ACORN for digital engineering. 

8. Roll out solar arrays (ROSA) - Astrobotic’s Lunar Vertical Solar Array Technology program to deliver power on the lunar surface. 8 ROSA Thales Alina Space has put ROSA on their GEO satellites as a baseline option, Blue Ring strategic partner, we have 25 orders as of September 2024.

9. SDA contracting- potential for trache 3 awards but at the very least will receive subcontracting work for their antenna line. Rocket Lab selected them as a subcontractor for their antennas which with how rocket lab is all about doing their own research/work, has shown how far ahead redwire is in this antenna tech and has imo given up the fight in this market. 

10. Their Robust camera line for both lunar/orbit, sun sensors/star trackers(Most of recent award for next generation interceptor program)

11. Fablab https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/redwire-wins-nasa-contract-to-advance-new-in-space-manufacturing-capability-for-journeys-to-moon-mars-and-beyond/

12. Developed systems to build landing pads, roads and other forms of infrastructure on the moon. 

13. Management looking after shareholder value.  CEO by the books alone has made it clear that they aren’t trying to flood the market with shares. CEO currently holds about 143,000 shares. The board/CEO is very tight with their wallet when it comes to share issuance.

"Nuclear Power, Crypto, and Monday Moves","Hello, I am back to talk more about SMR, UEC, and now MSTR. When I posted about SMR a week or two ago several people said that it was a bad investment as it has already grown 600+ percent this year. Look at where the stock is now. After recent statements by the upcoming USA administration I think I have seen more tickers with potential to have short term gains as well as long plays. 

SMR has recently hit 30 dollars and will continue to peak I believe around 33 as a resistance after watching its chart for sometime. I believed that it would drop in price so I sold my positions at 27 dollars hoping to repurchase at 24. It is still at 28. I am going to go in with calls on this one. I believe it will increase in price steadily with sharp early market peaks. Pay attention to the volume.  If you can scalp a cheap mid jan put at a reasonable 20 something dollar range I believe it will be wise. People will be fearful of the oil energy bro in office but the dude is pro nuclear. 

The bitcoin talk about us being the capital is real. Thats why these shitcoins scammers are at an all time high look at tiktok and look at instagram reels. The normies believe this is their entry to crypto but XMR x UDC collab will most likely happen in the next 2 years so get ready for that one. BitCoin == next gold for backing the XDR == cash dollar. If trump wants to mine collect and purchase bitcoin this will innevitably be NuScales in for the government contracts as in its already its baby. UEC is still a play in the fact that it will continue to go up. Most likely based off my analysis it will hit 9.35 by christmas and hit an 8$-7.87 price point before the administration takes charge. Domestic production is back and that applies to UEC who is making moves with plans they cant share with you right now.

MSTR is like 4x bitcoin which means its going to explode up or down with price. I think the silkroad is going to comeback and take its toll on bitcoins value. When trump is talking about making us the capital for crypto that means the complete end of crypto privacy. Not everyone was busted. Drug dealers, cartels, government bribes, and illegal deals. They are all apart of its rise and its current holdings. They will sell off before the boom causing a tanking of MSTR's price. I too believe short term it will explode in value in the ROCKET direction. But normies buying at 87k 90k 95k will have a mass sell off as well when it hits 110-115k as that is a logical smooth brain move to buy a house.  They don't care about cycles or the bitcoin rainbow. 

  
This isn't a scam or a self plug. Everything I am saying is what I am going to play and not financial advice. But I would love to have a discussion with you guys while I play dota.

$40 Oil? ,"30+ year oil field professional here. 

Key points: 
• Venezuela has massive oil reserves under US sanctions. 
• Russia is likewise
• President Elect Trump has promised lower gas prices

Allowing any one of these two oil producing countries to enjoy unsanctioned trading would suppress the price of oil through a rise in supply. Gasoline pricing promise(s) kept at that point.

Bitcoin ETF ideas for those of us that have been in since launch…,"I just realized options are now available on the bitcoin ETF’s.  I had been waiting for this!  I have 1000 shares of IBIT that are massively green, and I don’t see any reason not to sell covered calls against them.  At market open, someone is going to pay me almost $20,000 to lock in 10 contracts @ $100 strike price expiring in 2027.

That means IBIT would have to more than DOUBLE in just 2 years, for that buyer ***JUST TO BREAK EVEN*** for me to “lose money” on the trade.  So why the fuck would I not take that bet?  Even though I’m bullish!  I’m going to take your free $20,000 right now, sell you those contracts, and with that money I’m going to buy 350 more shares.  If IBIT goes anywhere near $100 a share by expiration, I’ll have far exceeded profits needed to close most of, if not ALL of those contracts out and have even more shares than I did before.

Before: 1000 shares
After: 1350 shares (1000 are covered by contract)

Here’s a “worst case” type scenario, IBIT 3x in 2 years to $150.  Looking at NVDA as a good comparison, sitting at $140 right now, I can look at the cost to close this week’s contract (I’d wait til close to expiry so that’s why I say this week’s) @ $100 would be $4,200 per contract so $42,000 for 10 of them.

The 350 shares I bought at $55 would be worth $52,500 for a net gain of $33,250.  So now I am able to sell just 270 shares at $150/piece to come up with the $42,000 I need to close those contracts and keep my shares, plus I’d have 80 more shares than I had to begin with.

So at the end of the day, even in a worst case scenario (stock jumps WAY over the strike I sold) I’m still a winner!

Best case scenario is IBIT ends Jan 2027 at $99.99 and above $38/share which would be my adjusted cost basis if I buy 350 shares at current $55 price.

In no scenario whatsoever can I lose, other than the complete collapse of BTC, which is always a possibility with anything so it’s an inherent risk of participation so it doesn’t count.",99,237,1732472490.0,bitcoin etf ideas us since launch,0.0

McDonald’s Espresso Machine Meltdown: $193M Burnt Nuggets or Billion-Dollar Golden Arches Play?,"This is weird. 

McDonald’s (MCD) is scrambling faster than a breakfast egg because their Melitta espresso machines just got yeeted out of every U.S. store. Safety concerns = no lattes, no cappuccinos, no mocha frappes. 🍮 A total 13,500 stores affected = $193M in financial black holes. But wait—it gets worse. If they don’t fix this fast, this could be McDonald’s ice cream machine scandal 2.0—with espresso.

The Drama
You know how they’re always like, “Sorry, the ice cream machine’s broken”? Well, now the espresso machines are dead too. McDonald’s had to RIP them out of every U.S. location because of some “unspecified safety concern.” I mean, who’s getting hurt by a cappuccino? Karen’s third-degree burn from asking for “extra hot”? 🔥☕

The Numbers
Here’s where it gets wild, fam. McDonald’s serves 27.2M customers a day in the U.S.:
	•	810K espresso drinks lost per day = $2.4M/day in lost sales.
	•	People skipping meals because no coffee = another $1.2M/day gone.
	•	That’s $153M in lost profit if this drags on for 60 days.
	•	Oh, and replacing the machines? Another $40.5M.

Total burn? $193M. That’s nearly **13% of their quarterly

Prepare for a significant NVDA pullback until the company reports more conclusively positive numbers on Blackwell ,"My breakdown touches upon:  

1)        Overall market context; 2) NVDA specific policy changes coming under Trump administration 

Overall market context is important, especially if we are headed for a correction or a consolidation period after the period of exuberance we have seen across asset classes. 

The overall market has largely yawned at potential tariffs, regulatory framework, and possibility of more export controls to Chinese market that could be enacted under a second Trump administration. Ex Goldman analyst Robin Brooks has alerted that markets are discounting the prospect of tariffs and how their effects could be really damaging for equities in 2025 ([https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst](https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst)). I don’t know whether there is hyperbole here, and if tariffs will actually cause pain for stocks, but it is at least worrying that the market has not seemed to care at all now that we know Trump will take office in January.

Goldman Sachs’ forecast shows robust 2.5% growth for the US economy in 2025, with slightly worst results if Trump enacts a 10% tariff on all imports. ([https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf)) Frankly, I believe Goldmans’ forecasting model is overly optimistic for two reasons. First, their estimates does not include a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imported goods, which Trump campaigned on. Nor does it include a scenario in which a large deportation program – both of which could have the effect of suppressing economic growth if implemented.

Wage growth has largely slowed and consumers would feel fatigued if a new bout of inflation rips across the economy—this would definitely have an impact on earnings. On top of this, a weakening labor market seems to threaten consumers’ comfortability with rising prices again.

One could argue that Trump’s immigration policies, including his plan for a large deportation initiative could see a tighter labour market, and rising wages that could counter a weakening labor market and slowing wage growth. But it’s important to be cognizant of the fact that tariffs would happen instantly, whereas deportations take time, and their effects would not be felt immediately throughout the economy.

Now that I’ve covered the overall market context, let’s get specific on NVDA.

Since NVDA reported earnings last week, the stock price has seesawed in pre-market trading as well as during trading hours. There has been plenty of pontification by market analysts either discounting or raising concerns about slowing sales growth and lower guidance going forward. The stock ended last week largely down, with significant selling happening on Friday.

But I want to focus on what’s in store for NVDA under a the administration.

Howard Lutnick, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump as Secretary of Commerce and USTR, has signaled his commitment to intensifying export controls on advanced semiconductors and related technologies to China. Lutnick’s statements and policy positions suggest a focus on maintaining U.S. dominance in critical technologies, particularly in the semiconductor sector, as a countermeasure to China's rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and military applications.

In a recent interview, Lutnick described semiconductors as ""the cornerstone of America's technological edge"" and emphasized that ""export controls are not merely economic tools but strategic weapons to protect our national security."" He has voiced strong support for continuing and expanding the Biden administration's measures, including targeting AI chips and semiconductor manufacturing tools.

Under Lutnick's guidance, policies could further restrict sales of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips to China. He has highlighted concerns about these chips enabling advanced AI capabilities that could be leveraged by the Chinese military. Lutnick stated, ""We cannot afford to let cutting-edge American technology become a tool for our adversaries,"" signaling potential restrictions on Nvidia and other U.S. tech firms developing high-performance semiconductors.

 The implications of Lutnick's policies could be significant. Stricter controls on exports, including modifications to loopholes that allowed companies like Nvidia to tailor products for the Chinese market, might accelerate China's efforts toward semiconductor self-sufficiency. U.S. firms could face reduced revenues, but Lutnick argues that ""short-term sacrifices are essential for long-term strategic security”.

In addition, we cannot discount the Biden administration making last minute policy moves to box in opponents and make it harder for the new incoming administration to deviate. This has already been reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/)). According to this report, the Biden administration is set to enact new regulations could make up to another 200 Chinese chip companies subject to a trade restriction list that bars most U.S. suppliers from shipping goods to the targeted firms. This news broke on Friday, but ten minutes before the market closed. If this is correct, it will put price pressure on the semiconductor sector, which could affect NVDA as well.

 I really do believe given this context, we are entering a period where NVDA could suffer, at least until we have more clarity on tariffs, export control regulations, and Blackwell sales numbers which won’t be reported on for some time.

The largest NVDA drawdowns that have happened recently (March-April; June-August; August-September) averaged anywhere between 21-30%. Smaller, more muted corrections have also occurred of around 10% in the stock since. A similar effect here (10% or so from its high of 152.88 would bring shares close to 137, and break through a key support level. A larger plunge could see it closer to 120 or below.

All in all, a dip here would be a good opportunity to buy up shares at a discounted price.

 I will be holding cash for buying on what I believe will be significant dips coming in the coming weeks, in the lead-up to inauguration and what will be a flurry of announcements as Trump will want to signal change and do so in true Trump fashion: loudly.

"I started this year with $15k, lost it all mid-year during the great bull run, and eventually built it back up to $60k through LEAPS.","After depositing $15k, I set a goal to invest in ‘value stocks’ and grow my portfolio by 20% annually, managing it myself by picking individual stocks.

I started by buying 10 stocks, including Celsius, Tesla, Arm, Ferrari, and others. My portfolio grew to $18k. From there, it fluctuated, and at the time, I knew nothing about options. Eventually, I decided to throw it all into one name when I saw its price spiking. My account hit $30k for the first time. However, I still hadn’t learned to take profits and was stuck in a scarcity mindset, feeling like I had to ride every trade ‘to the max.’ 🤦

After watching my portfolio tank back to $12k, I started revenge trading to recover losses but ended up nearly losing everything. That experience pushed me to learn about options, including the Greeks, implied volatility, and moneyness.

I then switched strategies, deciding to buy longer-dated options (LEAPS) with strikes that were somewhat ITM. I focused on companies that were ‘promising’ for the near to long term and had been beaten down. Instead of buying high and selling low, I started buying stocks at cheaper prices and simply waiting.

Over time, my account began growing steadily as I stuck to my strategy and waited for my take-profit targets to be hit. I traded into hyped small-caps before eventually selling all my positions to go all-in on quantum.

I'm not sure how many people remember but I made a hugely upvoted post here 6 months ago about winning $100k in just one hour by doing some crazy options gambling. The sad thing was I lost all of that $100k plus lost a further almost $80k in like a week later by thinking I could replicate my success yet again. I deleted that 100k post of mine after that out of shame but I still have like 100+ people that had private msg'ed me from that post alone.

June was really the lowest point in my journey here as you can see in the image. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought I could have made every single penny back plus a whooping $35k more by the end of this year. And it's not even the end of the year! I actually could've earned another $30k extra last week if not for some dumb mistakes lol

I had to change my entire outlook on investing after that June fiasco and believe it or not, I never bought any options ever since then. I wasn't going the crazed gambling route again and for the past 2 months I actually made very little gains but it was a low risk route I took.

My $130k gain only came about in the past 2 weeks' bull market and by constantly changing up my stocks instead of bagholding. There's still been a lot of regrets here and there in how I wished I made some trading moves that could've earned me even more money,  but I guess I cant be too greedy.",1697,216,1732350986.0,craziest journey ever made 100k one hour lost 180k 2 days later ive made back 136k,-0.3612

$OSCR - Kushner small cap trade ($23M in market buys),"[Josh Kushner open buys ](https://preview.redd.it/bs0xxldbmp2e1.png?width=2606&format=png&auto=webp&s=e03088ca5e9788e73506b1a2fbba6e7bd858b043)

tl;dr: Existing Trump trade stocks seem to have hit, so maybe next derivative to 10x is the Kushner trade (specifically around small caps), and all things associated with Thrive Capital? Oscar Health (OSCR) seems to be his favorite.

I've been watching current and past Thrive Capital Investments (Josh Kushner, brother of Jared Kushner Trump son-in-law) since the election.

Josh's firm, Thrive, seems to be great at picking winners with exits on Instagram, HIMS, LMND, CART, and currently with larger stakes in OpenAI and Oscar Health

\----- 

EDIT - Here is how I’m playing this ‘kushner’ and disruptive tech trade until March 2025. *I am regarded. I trade on vibes and patterns*

How I'm playing this (Calls: OSCR, LMND, HIMS, TSLA. Shares: BETR, LMND, TSLA):

1. OSCR shares and calls expiring March 2025 (health tech). Given the rate of DOGE announcements, I expect healthcare-related solutions to be pitched in next 1-2 months.
2. BETR shares (mortgage tech). This is still down 20x but has survived past 3 years, runway and an all in CEO (like PLTR, LMND). I hope/believe this is similar to Carvana. I got 3 mortgages through Better, know the CEO is a savage and survivor (zoom layoff CEO), and align with the company mission.
3. HIMS calls expiring Dec 27th 2024. I think thanksgiving convos and Xmas - there will be a lot of “what’s new smalltalk”. And many of those convos will circle around “hey, so I got these \_\_\_ pills from Hims - and life is great!” Pills include boner pills, hair growth pills, anti-anxiety / depression, and now GLP-1s.

**Tldr thesis:**

* There is a small cap rotation happening to superior tech innovators from 2020/2021 IPOs (most has already happened - Affirm, Palantir, Carvana, Peloton, etc.)
* Extreme Bull case is all of these small caps that didn’t die in past 3-4 years rebound as much as Carvana has (currently at 60x from low)

**Meta thesis (posted more** here**):**

* The transition of power, government, capital, and 'influence' will move from baby boomers (people that look like Pelosi or Mitch McConnell) will now transition to generation X (all in pod people, thiel, musk, theo von, rogan naval, balaji).
* They have disrupted 80% of industries owned by the baby boomers with the final boss being government. Which they just won. And will be on a warpath with DOGE
* All remaining shitty consumer experiences and entrenched older ways of doing things from misaligned incentives, grifts, and lobbylists (think shitty software like Concur, Cost+ contractors, Turbotax, NASA) will be fixed as part of this X generation transition.

"A plain English explanation of MSTRs convertible bond strategy (sort of long, sorry)","I just sent this in an email to a friend of mine who was asking about MSTR.  I also participated in some discussions of this in a few threads here yesterday so figured I could post it here as well for all you regards.  It might read a little bit like this is an email I sent to a friend who is financially literate.. because that’s what it is. 

Note: I’m not taking a firm position on what Saylor is doing.  For the record I’m a longtime Bitcoin bull (and semi-maxi) but there’s no such thing as infinite money.  This has massive potential to end badly… but the music is playing a lots of us are dancing.

This post contains some commentary and some of my opinions.  I’m happy to answer questions or correct anything I have wrong but I don’t plan to get drawn into debates about my opinions or the value of bitcoin and whatnot.  That’s a different topic. 

Dear Regards,

So, his convertible bond strategy is actually a hint of genius with a side of trepidation.  Here’s the rundown:

He’s selling 5-year corporate bonds at 0% interest with a convert price that’s about 50% above the current share price (I think that’s the ratio… could change per issuance, not sure).  For this example let’s say the stock is trading at $500 and the convert price is at $750. 

MSTR then uses the bond proceeds to buy bitcoin and add it to their balance sheet.  Bitcoin goes up.  Their value per share goes up.  Numbers go up.   Forever, right?  Right guys??

(See note below on accounting treatment.)

If the bond holder keeps the bonds for the full 5 years they get their principle paid back without interest.  

However if at any point in that 5 years the stock is trading above the convert price, the bond holder can surrender the bond and be issued stock shares (freshly created for the conversion) equivalent to the bond value at the convert price.  So if the shares are trading at $800 they could convert a $1m bond into 1,333 shares ($1m / $750 = 1333) and cancel the bond.  They would then have an implied profit of $66k on their million dollars ($50 above convert x 1333 shares).  They could sell to lock in profits or if they keep the shares they get additional upside/downside (or some combination)

That conversion is dilutive to existing shareholders but it only happens if the stock has already appreciated so the shareholders have been totally fine with it.  

The bond holders have an incentive to convert as it allows them to take profits ahead of the the 5 year term and they can either hold the shares or sell them or some combination.   Of course there is also a secondary market for these bonds and they are trading well above par in anticipation of high convert value. 

Once converted, the bond is paid/void.  So if his stock keeps going up he never has to pay back the bonds (with cash, anyway).

IIRC, the first bond issued like this was at a par value of $100 per share with a $140 convert price.   That was pre-split… so 1/10 that for current value ($10 per share with a $14 convert in today’s shares).  So those folks have done pretty well.  

So, these bonds are giving fixed income investors the upside exposure to Bitcoin and they are absolutely gobbling it up.  Most of those portfolios can’t buy bitcoin and many can’t even buy stocks/ETFs… but Bitcoin, wrapped in stock, wrapped in bonds… shut up and take my money!!!  

What could go wrong 😂

I’ve heard rumors that the next MSTR bond offering is going to be at a negative interest rate (ie investors will have to pay more than face value to buy the bond). 

However if the stock price doesn’t rise and the converts don’t happen, he’s on the hook to pay the bond back at the maturity date.  He has three options: (1) roll the debt into new bonds if the market will tolerate it, (2) pay the bonds off with cash on hand or with cash from the operating side of the business, or (3) sell enough of the underlying bitcoin to raise the cash.  He has said he will “never sell” but when push comes to shove who knows.  

Edit to add: he could also (4) issue additional shares to raise capital to pay off the bonds.  This would dilute shareholders and hurt his stock price but would be a valid strategy if needed. 

Of course if he’s having to sell some of his coins we can assume we are already in a deep bear market.  This selling would of course push the price down further.  Rinse and repeat.  That would suck.  And the more and more of these bonds he sells, the less and less likely it is that the operating business will have enough cash to pay them off.  Could get spicy. 

Importantly none of the Bitcoin are encumbered in these bonds and there is no opportunity for them to be called early or “margin called” in any way even if bitcoin price drops to zero.  They just need to pay off the bonds when they come due (if they ever come due). 

He is aware of the typical 4-year bitcoin boom and bust cycle and I expect he is structuring his maturity dates to account for when he would expect market lows and highs.  But that’s far from a guarantee.  

If he can’t pay the bonds he’s looking at an epic bankruptcy and his coins getting liquidated to pay creditors.  This would also cause massive market selling by essentially everyone frontrunning their bankruptcy sale.  FTX nods with knowing approval.  (Note this isn’t FTX 2.0 here… Saylor is doing this all in the open… this isn’t fraud it’s clever with risk)

His underlying plan is to entice other companies to follow in his footsteps so he’s not the only one pumping bitcoin.  I’m seeing more and more announcements all the time.  People are taking notice of his success.  I think this is really where the systemic risk applies.  MSTR is early to this game.  So far they are playing the game conservatively (well, ok… “conservatively”).    

But as other companies follow him down this path they will get more and more aggressive. It’s human nature.  Take what’s working and leverage it to the tits.  Once we have the lower third of the S&P index all doing the Saylor to goose their profits and bitcoin is trading in the millions and somebody fucks up because they took the bitcoin wrapped in stock wrapped in bonds and wrapped that in dog shit and wrapped that in cat shit and then sold it to the Saudis… the implosion risk is off the charts and it will be a huge risk/impact to the overall markets.  It will also wipe out anyone buying Bitcoin leverage long.  Dont fuck with BTC leverage kids. 

Interestingly tho… even it this all blows up it doesn’t threaten the bitcoin network.  The price will crash, sure, but miners will mine (some will go out of business but others will survive).  The network will still process transactions, there will still only ever be 21million coins.  And the price will recover to some level that reflects future demand.  No idea if it would ever recover to a new all time high… but it would survive and continue to function.   If you have your coins in self-custody you’ll be safe (aside from crying over the massive loss in dollar value).  Some new narrative would take over.  The asset would remain scarce.  A new narrative would emerge.  

Of course then there is all this talk of creating a national Bitcoin reserve where nation states are all in an arms race to aquire BTC.  For the record I’m very unenthusiastic about the National Bitcoin Reserve thing even if it would pump my bags.  It might happen but I don’t love the idea of massive government involvement in bitcoin.  

That said, Bitcoin is a permissionless network so if governments want to buy it there’s nothing anybody can do to stop them.  It’s a feature not a bug.  

Also regarding accounting treatment.  Bitcoin is current held with the tax treatment of “indefinite intangibles”.  This is the most conservative tax treatment possible.  It is for valuing things like art and trading cards.  If the value goes up you cannot recognize the appreciation higher than your purchase price.  If the value goes down you must recognize the loss (as an operating loss!). 

So that really sucks from a corporate perspective and I expect it has kept a lot of companies on the sidelines.  

The FASB accounting rules are changing in 2025 to shift bitcoin to fair value accounting. Going forward companies will mark to market quarterly (or whenever they announce earnings) and it will apply the profit or loss to the corporate treasury balance rather than operating income.   This will be a much more fair treatment and is the right way to do it given that Bitcoin has a very clear price discovery mechanism.  

Importantly, when MSTR reports their first earnings under this new rule, they’re going to be able to recognize all of the performance of all of the Bitcoin they have purchased.  Tons of it has been marked down (impared) since the drop from $69k to $15k.  And they haven’t been able to recognize gains on anything above price paid (ever!) on their official earnings statements.  Their first earnings of 2025 are going to be insanely higher than past and if the street is maintaining this high multiple it will get a lot of attention.  

On the other hand none of this is a secret so it’s probably already priced in.  It could explain some of the crazy price action lately as we get closer to Jan 1.  I think their fiscal year ends Dec31 so Q1 earnings in April would see the 🚀 in their standard balance sheet.  

A brave new world.

tl;dr long Bitcoin, long MSTR, massive risk once tons of other companies follow suit because people are greedy bastsrds and will lever this strategy to the tits and it will blow up in a supernova of financial ruin… and Bitcoin will still keep chugging along same as it ever was.

tl;dr2 in five years Saylor will either be the richest man in the world or he’ll be in the back of the Turkish embassy being dismembered by a Saudi hit squad for destroying MBS’s oil fortunes.

Death, taxes, and caffeine being centerfold in American society. The explosion of $CELH into the energy drink market took the sector by storm, and investors gobbled up the stock. In four years, the company became the third most popular energy drink in the United States behind just Rebull and Monster, That kind of growth is unprecedented in a stagnant industry like soft drinks.

But then sentiment changed and the exponential growth began to slow as the industry faced inflationary headwinds and gas station traffic decreased. Retail investors dropped CELH faster than the democrats dropped Biden.

I'm here to tell you the market is wrong about Celsius, and in two years you will be wishing you had read this post and got onboard.

The underlying fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong and there remains massive global growth potential. Every quarter, CELH is a profitable business. They posted $0.28 EPS in Q2. They have close to a BILLION dollars of CASH on hand. This past quarter, their largest distributor, Pepsi, did an inventory optimization that decreased sales for the quarter by $150 million and the company STILL broke even for the quarter. CELH announced the inventory optimization is complete and those sales will resume for Q4.

Any business needs to be incredibly healthy to take a one-time $150 million decrease in sales for a quarter on the chin and STILL be operating in the green. Retail investors looked at the decreased quarterly revenue and panic sold the stock without listening to the earnings call and actually understanding the numbers. It was a one-time, inventory optimization with the expectation of sales resuming in Q4. And that's what we've seen with the stock price - while retail investors have abandoned the stock, institutional ownership has increased 400% in 2024.

CELH sales growth in the United States has continued to outpace competition and global marketing/sales remain in the early stages. The top line has enormous grwoth potential in global markets. Meanwhile, in Q3 CELH bought Big Beverages in an all cash transaction in order to vertically integrate one of their major manufacturers. The facility is massive and the acquisition is expected to decrease per-case production cost and further improve margins.

The stock price has already started making a turnaround from the panic selling post-earnings. Thank me in two years.",138,98,1732302672.0,celh yolo market wrong,-0.25
Here is how the MSTR Can Reach 2000 By The End Of The Year 2024... I was bearish 2 weeks ago. What do you guys think?,"https://preview.redd.it/62lk42brvi2e1.png?width=1011&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d5883631884d2e4b5b6133447fd8e23a7cb34e2

I finally understand and realize how MSTR’s stock could grow so quickly if everything goes as planned. Here’s my view of a relatively bullish scenario that could unfold by the end of 2024:

In just the last two weeks, Saylor bought 29K and 52K BTC using stock offerings (ATMs). As the stock price and trading volume are now much higher (2x from last week plus stock price is 50% higher), he’ll likely buy even more BTC weekly.

Let’s assume the premium remains steady, allowing Saylor to keep leveraging it to buy as much BTC as possible. If he continues issuing shares through ATM programs and announces new purchases weekly, and adds debt every two weeks as he’s been doing, the pace could accelerate further.

He might even raise more than the planned $42B since the demand is there. It's insane, how fast they are growing. He said he will get $1.7B debt, then two days later he raised to $2.6B, and after several hours announced $3B. All this happened this week.  
If no one intervenes, he could potentially aim for holding 20% of all BTC—around 4 million coins. But this scenario stops at 1.38M BTC by the EOY 2024.

These numbers feel realistic yet conservative. If things heat up further, this could look even more dramatic. Although the stock trading volume is growing, here the assumption is that it will decrease.

Just two weeks ago, these projections would have seemed completely ridiculous to me. But now, it’s all starting to make sense.

MARA vs MSTR vs HUT: Bitcoin treasury comparisons,"https://preview.redd.it/6dhobb43hi2e1.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=362823b3680fec6fb1b8186bf1717e49f46c2920

I made a comparison of the top btc-linked equities who own the most btc... a) MSTR, b) MARA, and c) HUT ... i want to preface this by saying *all* BTC-linked equities deserve *some* premia in a bull market. The question is how much & when.

MSTR was trading at $478K per bitcoin yesterday morning... so yesterday's correction was *good* news... it re-rated... to <$400K per bitcoin... i have a feeling the premia is gona expand again though and Saylor will tap the convert markets 3-4x more from now until the Spring. The stock can double from here. Because MSTR's software operations are winding down, it justifies its premia by promising it will be a sort of 'bitcoin bank' in the future. TBD.

MARA was never really known on Wall Street for its HODL, but since the shares were flat as BTC went from $60K to $90K, the HODL now puts it in the top 3 BTC treasury plays. In the past, 80-90% of MARA's market cap was attributable to its operating company: the mining facilities. That has now changed. It's become more & more of a BTC proxy. This is a monumental shift. I didn't believe it 100% until I crunched the numbers, and looked at their latest debt offering... MARA is a top 2 mining/HODL play. It's a new landscape for miners.

HUT was always known as the classic HODL play if you didn't want to touch MSTR... especially as BTC ETFs didn't have any options contracts. If you wanted levered long BTC exposure, you had to either play MSTR or HUT. When MSTR got out of control, traders looked to call options on HUT to get that levered long exposure. HUT is still the biggest HODL play in the mining arena, and due to the recent underperformance, it's also the best value (in terms of cheapest price per BTC). HUT shareholders have also been much less diluted than MARA shareholders, and HUT's float is much tighter than MARA's. Furthermore, HUT's short intrst is double MARA's, creating extra volatility. I suspect the options market on HUT will begin to price this in as HUT shares begin to move again, but nobody knows. They can always sink too. HUT's smaller size has the added benefit of making it a more realistic M&A target (for both corporates and PE), which is always a nice uplift due to the premia often paid to shareholders in a buyout scenario. I like both HUT and MARA at these levels.

$U - A potential game engine comeback story.,"Wanted to try it out so here's my first 'analysis'! Let me know if my points are valid and if my structuring is good or not.

Firstly for some background information, $U or Unity Software Inc is primarily game engine company where although producing a relatively good game engine, has made some incredibly poor choices - such as mass layoffs and diverging from their engine to focus more on advertising, merging with Iron Source. The company peaked in value November '21 at almost $200 (USD) where the company began merging with other companies, months after the decently successful IPO - the first merger being with Weta Digital. After that peak, it was all downhill from there tumbling into the $40s over the course of two years, where Unity made gaming history by announcing the runtime fee. This lead to the regarded CEO resigning (the CEO that once ran EA, go figure) and most of management being fired, with major restructuring a few months after occurring under interim CEO Jim Whitehurst and then Matthew Bromberg, where they promised to work on what truly mattered, the engine itself.

In recent times, Unity has made great strides in their engine with massive new features on the way - promising better performance (they don't say it, but they subtly hint it in their advertising that Unity is the engine for good performance, as opposed to Unreal), and new innovative uses of that big A word that investors climax over. They announced Unity 6, their big update and reversion back to a normal naming system as opposed to their weird yearly naming scheme (which was objectively bad for pressuring new releases on a yearly schedule), and announced 6.1 with some features currently in alpha releases, and some credible promises for later big versions which they appear committed on.

Overall, they seem to be on a comeback, at least on the engine side. Financially, they've been recovering from the whole runtime debacle (around Q4-23) where the next quarter being their first missed earnings for a while, by quite a bit as well. Where only recently in Q2-24 have they started to beat the target and are on track to go above $0 per share in the next two years. In addition, as a result of the cancellation of the runtime fee and the new CEO reaching out to businesses and the community, growth has been re-sparked. Moreover, their profits from their engine have increased 5% year over year and is still going strong. In the recent Q3 earnings their total profits in EBITDA is over 10% over their initial estimate of $70-80m at $92m.

My verdict, is that the company under its new leadership has shifted its focus towards the user. They are focussing on updating their engine without hurting users using older features, and are in the testing phases of new AI technologies for both advertising (reducing ROI and boosting user acquisition + monetary gain), and game development (with two AI systems for both helping developers make games, and running AI within games for either NPCs or game systems). Thus, after a 'company reset' they seem to be on the track to make a profit and become the defacto game engine - one that won't be made fun of crappy games.

Disclaimer - this is not financial advice. I'm a game developer and I enjoy using their engine (which is how I can say the engine is getting far better in recent releases for engine users), I recently got into trading/investing and I read these analysis posts or bets, and I decided to try one out myself.

How'd I do?

Edit: MB forgor to say my position. I'm dirt poor so I put $70 in Unity at around $17usd with 5x leverage... if that means anything to u guys?",37,24,1732311554.0,u potential game engine comeback story,0.0

Between October 31 and November 5, 2024, its stock market price fell from $20.63 to $11.63, a decline of 43.62%.
